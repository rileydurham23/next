    title: "Proxy Service",
    description:
      "The proxy is the only service in a cluster visible to the outside world. All user connections for all supported protocols go through the proxy. The proxy also serves the Web UI and allows remote IoT nodes to establish reverse tunnels. Several proxies can be set up for high availability.",

    title: "Auth Service",
    description:
      "The auth service acts as a certificate authority (CA) for the cluster. It issues certificates for clients and for nodes, collects the audit information, and stores it in the audit log. Several copies of the auth service can be set up for high availability. The auth service can be configured via `tctl` command line tool.",

    title: "Audit Log",
    description:
      "All nodes in a cluster send security-related events to the auth service, which then stores them in the audit log. Audit log information is stored in a regular file system, but cloud stores like DynamoDB are also supported. There are two types of audit information: recorded user sessions and security events like command execution or network activity.",

    title: "Teleport Client",
    description:
      "Teleport comes with a command line client called `tsh`, but it also can be used with `ssh`. In addition to command line, Teleport also offers a web-based client. When accessing Kubernetes clusters, `kubectl` and other K8s-based tools work as usual.",

    title: "Reverse Tunnel",
    description:
      "A remote node creates a reverse tunnel by establishing a permanent connection to the proxy. This tunnel is used to establish connections from clients to remote nodes located behind NAT. Remote nodes always try to re-connect and recreate the tunnel if their internet connectivity is intermittent.",

    title: "SSH Node",
    description:
      "An SSH node is a regular Linux machine. It can be bare metal or a cloud instance. The `teleport` SSH daemon is stateless and nearly configuration-free because it is purpose-built for certificate-based authentication. You can also configure the `sshd` daemon that comes with OpenSSH to join a Teleport cluster.",

      "Teleport is an identity-aware application proxy. This means that any web application running on LAN/VPC can be exposed to the outside world via an HTTP/TLS endpoint served by a Teleport proxy. This dramatically simplifies managing security and authentication for internal web apps.",
