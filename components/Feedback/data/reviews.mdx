    Teleport reduces the operations and the support burden normally associated with
    on-premises software. The product also decreases the time it takes to adopt open
    source technology while enabling consistent application environments across deployments

    Teleport allows us to comply with the regulatory hurdles that come with running an international stock exchange. The use of bastion hosts,
    integration with our identity service and auditing capabilities give us a compliant way to access our internal infrastructure.

    Teleport has made obtaining a FedRAMP-Moderate ATO that much more achievable via their FIPS 140-2 endpoints, ease in integration with our SSO and MFA , and the view into audit
    logs of remote connection sessions provide the appropriate insight for Continuous Monitoring.

    We were looking for a simplified way to be able to package up the Kubernetes infrastructure – to be able to set it up, to manage it, provide all
    the underlying tool sets – so we picked a partner that knows how to do this. It’s a build versus buy decision; we decided to go with people where Kubernetes is their core competency.

  text: Teleport simplified our remote terminal access procedures. SSH to an AWS cloud instance is not a headache anymore. Through the Teleport Web UI, developers are no longer required to remember the random instance's IP address or the meaningless hostname. It is as easy as browsing a website now. Also, Teleport makes our security audit job easier. It is now just like watching a video!

  text: Teleport provided a secure, transparent and easy way for Auth0 to access our customer environments and achieve SSH Requirements and PCI Compliance. It helped our Managed Services Engineering Team to provide support 24x7 to our customers worldwide. We went from about 20 environments to over 120 in less than a year.

  text: Usability really speaks to the problem that Teleport solves when it comes to all these auditable standards — make something that’s usable and auditable. It has to be secure, period, and that’s table stakes. But if it’s not usable, no one’s going to use it.

    We’ve been able to step back from writing all these custom toolings, how to maintain that tooling, key management etc., and just focus on how do we map our single sign-in provider into roles in Teleport.
    We no longer have to worry about key management, we no longer have to worry about different places we’re managing user access, we all just do it through one single place, which is fantastic.

  text: We use Teleport Access Requests in combination with Auth0 to easily manage access to our infrastructure. Prior to Teleport, we manually managed SSH keys and a bastion machine and it was an organizational nightmare. It has great configuration options, and the UI is great for junior engineers that may need access to certain infrastructure, but aren't very SSH savvy.
