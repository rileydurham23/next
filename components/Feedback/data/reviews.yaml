    Teleport reduces the operations and the support burden normally associated with
    on-premises software. The product also decreases the time it takes to adopt open
    source technology while enabling consistent application environments across deployments

    Teleport has made obtaining a FedRAMP-Moderate ATO that much more achievable via their FIPS 140-2 endpoints, ease in integration with our SSO and MFA , and the view into audit
    logs of remote connection sessions provide the appropriate insight for Continuous Monitoring.

    We were looking for a simplified way to be able to package up the Kubernetes infrastructure – to be able to set it up, to manage it, provide all
    the underlying tool sets – so we picked a partner that knows how to do this. It’s a build versus buy decision; we decided to go with people where Kubernetes is their core competency.

Through the Teleport Web UI, developers are no longer required to remember the random instance's IP address or the meaningless hostname. It is as easy as browsing a website now. Also, Teleport makes our security audit job easier. It is now just like watching a video!
