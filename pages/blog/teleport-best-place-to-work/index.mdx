At the core of every great company are the incredible individuals who work hard to create its success. We believe in our team members and aim to support and invest in their wellbeing and professional development — trusting each other to get the hard work done, and understanding that life happens along the way.

With that in mind, our team works hard to maintain a high standard in every aspect including company perks & benefits — aiming to innovate and be responsive to our employees. Lately, our efforts are being recognized outside of Teleport, too. Back in August, we were [named a Great Place to Work for 2021](/blog/teleport-a-great-place-to-work/).

The awards keep coming. We’re happy to announce that Teleport has recently received two other awards: Best Company for Work-Life Balance, and Best Company for Perks & Benefits from [Comparably](https://www.comparably.com/about-us). Comparably’s mission is to make workplaces transparent and rewarding for both employees and employers, and these awards are solely determined by employees’ feedback.

## What do wellness and work-life balance mean for Teleporters?

We didn’t start out as a remote-first company, but being responsive and innovative allowed us to quickly adapt during the pandemic. We celebrate our global team and embrace asynchronous communication and collaboration through tools but also a collaborative culture that prioritizes effective communication and writing things down. Whether in the office or working from home, we believe that flexibility is the key to a productive workplace, and we trust our team members as professionals. Having a clear understanding of our metrics for success frees us to not micromanage where and when it is accomplished.

Here at Teleport, investing in wellness is extremely important because it leads to happier and more productive employees. This is why we as a company have an extended wellness benefit that allows each person to determine what they want to invest in. Each person is unique, and their wellness needs are unique too. Below are just a few examples from our team members of how they’ve used the benefit:

- A new mattress for better quality sleep
- A treadmill so they can run year-round even in winter climates
- A new ergonomic chair for better posture and spine support
- An Apple watch to track activity and mindfulness
- Guitar lessons
- A high-quality espresso machine

## The importance of strong benefits & work-life balance

Trust, flexibility and autonomy are key to our success. We provide a flexible and generous paid time off policy, excellent benefits, and engaging activities including virtual cooking classes and game nights (our Among Us game events are super fun!).

As we talked about, our most recent benefit, a $7000 yearly wellness allotment for each employee gives team members the flexibility to decide what will provide them with the greatest value. Whether that’s a new home gym set up, weekly therapy sessions, or a smart watch, we trust employees to decide what wellness looks like for them.

The happier our employees are in their lives, the happier they will be at work, too. We want to enable our employees to show up 100% focused and excited to jump into their work, and we have crafted supportive perks and benefits to help us achieve that.
