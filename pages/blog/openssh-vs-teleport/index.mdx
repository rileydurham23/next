This came up in a recent conversation with a Teleport user:

<Quote>
  Hey Ev -- If we can simply configure sshd on our Linux machines to trust our
  Teleport’s Auth Server’s certificate authority, why bother installing the
  Teleport Node Service on individual nodes? Especially for short-lived cloud
  instances or immutable OSs like Container Linux. What are you thinking? Why
  not KISS?
</Quote>

Yes, existing fleets of OpenSSH servers can be configured to accept SSH
certificates dynamically issued by a Teleport CA. This makes it easier and
quicker to adopt Teleport and often is used as the first step.

However, replacing routinely used openssh daemons with Teleport Node Service
has a few key benefits which we’ll cover in this post. If top-shelf security is
important to you or your organization, you should consider deploying Teleport
onto every server. Otherwise, you can continue using Teleport strictly in a
certificate authority + proxy mode. The benefits of a site-wide Teleport SSH
deployment include:

1. Built-in Server Authentication;
2. A more secure configuration for audit and [session recording](https://goteleport.com/features/);
3. [Role Based Access Control](https://goteleport.com/teleport/features/rbac-for-ssh/); and
4. Cluster Introspection.

We’ll go into some more detail below.

## Automatic Server Authentication

When was the last time you saw this?

```text
The authenticity of host '[node.example.com]:22 ([73.231.13.15]:22)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:0OB3Z21GUSYDotZoN/uhy/g1kFJSBqUzLoMNSWezMDE
Do you want to continue?
```

This is often called [trust on first use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use),
and it happens because a user’s client computer has never connected to
node.example.com before. In either case, an attacker can hijack the DNS entry
for node.example.com and point it to a rogue server for a user to login into.

Why is this a problem? After some thought, something like this will come to mind:

```bash
$ scp valuable-data.tar.gz node.example.com:/backups/
```

You may not be doing exactly this, but it illustrates the point that when
connecting to an SSH node, a user _definitely_ wants to trust it. But it is hard
to trust a node by looking at its key fingerprint, and managing host signatures
is just as hard as managing static SSH keys.

Many otherwise reasonable people simply accept unknown host keys and hope for
the best by adding something like this to their SSH config:

```
Host *
   StrictHostKeyChecking no
   UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
```

Yes it seems insane, but we often see that hack employed inside “secure”
internal networks. We do not recommend this.

This problem does not exist in a fleet-wide Teleport cluster because:

1. All connections to nodes happen through a Teleport proxy.
2. Every Teleport node must join the cluster before any connections can be
   routed to it.

When a Teleport node comes online for the first time, it uses what's called a
"cluster join token". This token can be either single-use (and it can be
distributed to new nodes automatically via something like [Amazon KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html))
or it can be statically pre-configured. A node uses this token to retrieve its
own certificate, very much like a regular Teleport user would.

Within a native Teleport node session, during an SSH login, the node presents
its node certificate and a user presents their user certificate, both of them
signed by the same Teleport CA, removing the possibility of a rogue node
getting in the way.

## Cluster Introspection

Unlike OpenSSH, the Teleport SSH daemon periodically (every 5 seconds by
default) sends a service ping to a Teleport CA. This ping serves two purposes:

1. It notifies the cluster that the node is online. This allows users to see
   what nodes are available via introspective features like running `tsh ls`
   (even across different trusted clusters). Many users also like the
   convenience of being able to eyeball and search their server fleets in
   Teleport’s web UI.

2. The ping is also used to submit the information about node state to the
   cluster which can then be used for accessing nodes by dynamic labels. The
   former is self-explanatory, so let's look into the latter.

Suppose there are two PostgreSQL servers configured in master-slave
configuration. When a master fails, a slave is usually elected to become a new
master. Eventually it becomes impossible to know which server is master at any
given time just by looking at its IP address or a DNS name.

Teleport SSH daemon can be configured to periodically run a script, take the
output from it and use that output as a label for the node.

This can be nifty for things like this:

```bash
$ tsh ssh user@label=postgres-master
```

This command will establish an SSH connection to whichever node happens to be
the master. In a case when multiple nodes have the same label (like
"env=staging") one can execute the same command on all of the staging machines via:

```bash
$ tsh ssh user@env=staging <command>
```

Obviously there are other ways to do this, but Teleport offers it as a built-in
convenience.

## Role-Based Access Control

This benefit only applies to users of commercial Teleport editions, but the
idea is to dynamically restrict SSH permissions to specific user groups
(roles). Perhaps you only want to allow port forwarding on staging and only to
the team members who have a special role, etc. Teleport implements RBAC by
encoding role permissions into SSH certificate metadata. These extended
certificate attributes cannot be interpreted by an OpenSSH server. Therefore,
advanced RBAC features are only available if Teleport is deployed onto every
node in a cluster.

## Other Differences

If SSH session recording is required in combination with OpenSSH servers, the
recording must take place inside of a Teleport proxy, which means a proxy must
terminate (decrypt) every SSH connection which comes through it and re-encrypt
it again when connecting to a destination. We believe this makes the cluster
less secure.

On the other hand, deploying Teleport onto every server switches the recording
to destination nodes, which makes every SSH connection end-to-end encrypted. In
this configuration, connections are impossible to read even if an attacker
gains physical access to the cluster’s proxy server. (A cluster’s proxy server
is usually the only node exposed outside of firewalls.)

## Conclusion

Using OpenSSH servers is possible and may be desirable during a transition, but
there are some tremendous benefits in switching to a full, fleet-wide [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/)
deployment including:

- Built-in Server Authentication;
- A more secure configuration for audit and session recording;
- Role-Based Access Control; and
- Cluster Introspection
