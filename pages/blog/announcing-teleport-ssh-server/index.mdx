Our end goal is to help people manage their applications on
multiple locations. Our flagship product
[Gravity](https://goteleport.com/) solves two main challenges -
deploying applications across multiple environments and then once they are
there, operating and maintaining them. The second challenge requires an access
layer that is compatible with existing (mostly SSH-based) workflows and
scalable across multiple clusters of servers and multiple ops teams.

[Teleport](https://goteleport.com/) is that access layer. And today we are excited to announce
that we are open sourcing this fundamental component of the Gravity platform.

Teleport was built with security and usability across distributed environments
as the primary design principles. We made Teleport compatible with OpenSSH so
it works with many existing systems and work flows with minimal changes. Beyond
traditional SSH, we added features to make it secure and easy to use for teams
with modern, distributed applications, including:

- Two-factor authentication
- Short-lived certificates
- Dynamic labeling for services
- Multi-user sessions ("hangouts for terminal")
- The ability to playback sessions
- Mandatory auditing (every event is recorded and stored)
- A web-based user interface (in addition to the CLI)

### More Info

You can learn more about Teleport's design and internals at its [landing
page](https://goteleport.com/) and [Github
repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport). It is not ready for
production use, yet, but we encourage people to review, play with it and
provide feedback. We are currently undergoing a security review and will update
the repo's README.md when we are comfortable recommending it for production
use.
