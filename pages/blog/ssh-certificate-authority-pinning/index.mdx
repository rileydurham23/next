## Using HPKP to Bootstrap SSH Trust and Improve User Experience

Kubernetes **`kubeadm`** users might have noticed a familiar flag when adding nodes to a Teleport cluster starting
in 3.1: **`ca-pin`**. This new ability to pin a Teleport SSH Certificate Authority is used not only to help
bootstrap trust, but also used to remove the need for out-of-band distribution of cryptographic material to machines running the Teleport
[SSH & kubectl recording daemon](https://goteleport.com/how-it-works/audit-logging-for-ssh-and-kubernetes/).

```
$ tctl nodes add
The invite token: cf24c30b6d9f9c780c219cd5af000856
This token will expire in 30 minutes

Run this on the new node to join the cluster:

> teleport start \
   --roles=node \
   --token=cf24c30b6d9f9c780c219cd5af000856 \
   --ca-pin=sha256:79a6c30c7e7310b0a66778...f858ab846f7021f1429eb6 \
   --auth-server=10.12.0.6:3025
```

## The Problem: Bootstrapping Trust to Remediate Trust on First Use

To secure a connection between a client and server, one or both sides need to authenticate each other. For example, when using webmail the
client (web browser) uses public key cryptography to authenticate the server (Gmail) by validating the x509 certificate presented by the
server is signed by a trusted party known as a Certificate Authority (CA). The list of authorities to trust is usually bundled into the
operating system or the web browser itself and is transparent to the user. It's sometimes called a trust store. For the other side of the
connection, the server validates the client by asking the client to present some kind of secret token, typically a password, that was
established ahead of a time (typically during registration).

When a Teleport Node asks a Teleport Auth Server to join a Teleport ssh or kubectl cluster, a similar exchange occurs. The big difference is
that because each Teleport cluster is itself managing a private certificate authority, and furthermore the CA is itself often automatically
rotated, the private Teleport CA is not in the joining node's operating system trust store. So how does a Teleport ssh daemon verify the
identity of the Teleport server?

One way is to export the x509 certificate of the CA like in Figure (2) and place it at a well known location on disk. Then the client can
read it in and use it to validate the certificate presented by the Auth Server. Sophisticated ops teams typically have infrastructure
in-place to distribute internal certificate authorities to all nodes, but what about someone starting out with Teleport or maybe customers
that don't have the more sophisticated infrastructure yet. How do they authenticate the connection to the Auth Server?

## The Solution: SSH Certificate Authority Pinning

Inspiration for the solution came in the form of Kubernetes. Users of **`kubeadm`** are probably familiar with the

**`--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash`** flag, which is essentially what Teleport's **`--ca-pin`** flag is.

If you want to go to the source and read more about this, you can read the Kubernetes
[documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-join/), [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/49520), or [design
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SP4P7LJWSA8vUXj27UvKdVEdhpo5Fp0QHNo4TXvLQbw/edit?ts=5971498a).

If you want a quick rundown, this is how [Teleport's SSH certificate authority
pinning](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/admin/#untrusted-auth-servers/) works:

First the Teleport node connects to the Teleport Auth Server over an insecure connection and asks for the public key of the private CA. The
Teleport node process parses the certificate, then calculates the SHA256 hash of the **`RawSubjectPublicKeyInfo`**
field which consists of the public key and public key algorithm. If this hash value does not match the value in the

**`--ca-pin`** parameter, Teleport bails out because the connection may be compromised in some manner.

If the hash does match, Teleport attempts to build a fully secured connection the Auth Server using the CA obtained over the insecure
connection to validate the certificate presented by the Auth Server. If Teleport's node agent can not validate the certificate chain, once
again Teleport will bail out because the connection may be compromised in some manner. If Teleport can validate the chain, it knows it has
connected to its legitimate Teleport Auth Server.

We're pretty excited about this feature because not only does it hit an important security goal of mutual authentication, it's also
downright user friendly.
