## Introduction

In this post we'll explain how to generate and use `~/.kube/config` for
Kubernetes clusters running on GKE without having to install Google Cloud Tools
like `gcloud`. This can be impractical on machines that use automation (run
CI/CD). Or perhaps you wish to keep your Kubernetes tooling independent
of a specific cloud provider.

First, let's go over the regular workflow of a GKE user:

## Authenticating with GKE

If you are adopting Google's Kubernetes Engine (aka,
[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)) you will want to connect `kubectl` to your GKE-hosted Kubernetes cluster.
Usually, this is accomplished by pressing "connect" button on GKE portal
which then brings up something like the following instruction:

We will copy & paste the shell command from above for better clarity:

```bash
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --project <project-name>
```

Generates a `~/.kube/config` file with the necessary credentials for
`kubectl` to use. However, it also means that:

1. You must have `gcloud` installed on your machine.
2. You must be authenticated with Google's cloud first.
3. You have to have a web browser available, i.e. the authentication is
   interactive.

Below is the complete sequence of commands you'll have to use to generate `~/.kube/config`
with the `gcloud` tool:

```bash
# This will open a web browser and you'll authenticate with your email, password
# and the second factor (which you of course should be using)
$ gcloud auth login

# And now generate the kubeconfig:
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster --zone us-central1-a --project my-project

# Check if it works:
$ kubectl get nodes
```

if you did everthing right, you should see the list of nodes in the cluster.
Obviously this is not optimal for robots, CI/CD pipeline, etc.

## Authenticating Without Google Cloud Tools

The setup above works quite well if you're using it on a laptop which has a web
browser installed and you are only using GKE Kubernetes clusters. However,
many of our customers have expressed interest in using Kubernetes-native
authentication which does not depend on Google's proprietary tooling and does
not require the user to interactively login via a web browser.

Fortunately, this is quite easy to do!

Here is what you need to do to non-interactively authenticate against GKE
Kubernetes clusters without using the certificate authentication built into
Kubernetes itself:

1. First, obtain the GKE credentials using the workflow described above. You
   have to do this just once.
2. Connect to the Kubernetes cluster and request a new certificate using the
   [Kubernetes CSR API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/).
   We have a [sample script](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/examples/gke-auth/get-kubeconfig.sh). You can use as a starting point (or as-is).

The resulting `kubeconfig` can be placed on CI/CD machines and used in any kind
of infrastructure automation which requires `kubectl`.

The certificate returned by the CSR API does not have an expiration date and
will keep working forever. If you wish to automatically rotate these
certificates, you can implement your own tooling around this, or use
[Teleport](https://goteleport.com/pam-for-kubernetes), our infrastructure gateway
which provides unified access to both SSH and Kubernetes clusters.

Update: we've been contacted via Twitter by a Google Engineer who has written a
blog article for the very same scenario.

Instead of creating a new certificate, he uses a workstation where `gcloud` is
present and creates a static `kubeconfig` which is then copied to the target
system that will use it. You can find his article
[here](https://ahmet.im/blog/authenticating-to-gke-without-gcloud/).
