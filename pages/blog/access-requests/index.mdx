## Introduction

Making frequent changes to cloud applications running in production is the
de-facto standard. To minimize errors, engineers use CI/CD automation,
techniques like code reviews, green-blue deployments and others.

_Git pull requests_ often serve as a foundational component for triggering code
reviews, Slack notifications, and subsequent automation such as testing and
deployments. This automated process enforces peer reviews and creates enough
visibility to minimize human error. Pull requests work quite well.

But what happens when a production PostgreSQL database, some SSH nodes, or a
certain Kubernetes cluster needs troubleshooting? Unfortunately, quite often an
engineer will just access those resources using a shared credential, without a
formalized approval process, increasing possibility for human error or
compromising security. Larger companies tend to take a more conservative
approach and employ excessive bureaucracy, slowing everyone and everything
down.

But what if an engineer could create a "git pull request" requesting temporary
access to critical production infrastructure? Then her peers would review and
approve such requests, granting her temporary access, with solid security and
compliance guarantees.

In this blog post, we’ll explain how this can be done.

## What is an Access Request?

First, let's introduce the [access request](https://goteleport.com/features/access-requests/) concept. An access request allows for
temporary elevation of privileges for accessing cloud infrastructure; i.e.,
resources like SSH servers, Kubernetes clusters, databases or internal web
applications such as Grafana dashboards.

Access requests are important because they allow us to implement the principle
of least privilege without slowing down the engineering team.

In practice, **this means that root-type accounts are no longer needed**. Think of
access requests as a one-time `sudo` which needs to be approved by the rest of
the team.

Obviously, for access requests to work well, the process of requesting and
approving access must be quick and painless. We will show how to quickly
implement Access Requests using [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/), an identity-aware access proxy with
support for various access protocols, including SSH, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL,
MySQL, HTTPs, etc. Teleport is a [simple UNIX daemon](https://goteleport.com/how-it-works/)
available as an open source download, hosted cloud offering, or enterprise solution.

## How to Use Access Requests?

Here's how Access Requests work:

- The engineer Alice tries to access a resource but gets an "Access denied"
  message.
- She types another CLI command requesting access. She is required to provide a
  reason for access and the required time interval.
- Her peers (or a dedicated security team) receive a notification via Slack or
  a similar tool.
- They review the request, hence the similarity with git pull requests, and can
  approve or deny it.
- For mission-critical resources, the approval must be granted by several team
  members.

Here's how it looks in practice when accessing an important box via SSH, for
example:

```bash
# Alice tries to access a database box, but she does not have
# enough privileges:
$ ssh db-box
Access denied

# She requests to be temporarily added to the “DBA” group,
# and she must specify a reason. In this case, it’s a
# support ticket #1234
$ tsh request new --roles=dba --reason=”ticket #1234”
Seeking request approval...
```

Now Alice is waiting for her request to be approved. Meanwhile, her team
receives a notification in Slack:

It is possible to configure access requests to be approved by more than one
team member. In the example above, the security team members can approve or
deny Alice's request using Slack as shown above, but Mattermost, Jira and
PagerDuty are also supported.

Moreover, it is possible to customize the approval process via code. You can
build integrations into your own ChatOps tool or even implement a fully
automatic approval based on arbitrary business logic.

## Auditing Access Requests

Access request approvals and denials are logged for future audit into
Teleport's audit log. Teleport also records all user actions during the
session, which could be replayed later in a YouTube-like UI.

At any given time, it is possible to see all outstanding access requests:

```bash
# tctl is the Teleport’s administration tool. Let’s list all
# outstanding requests:
$ tctl request ls

Token              Requestor Metadata   Created At (UTC)  Status
------------------ --------- ---------  ----------------- -------
bc8ca931-fec9-4b15 alice     roles=dba  07 Nov 19 19:38   PENDING
f3234632-d32a-a33f bob       roles=dba  07 Nov 19 19:22   PENDING
```

## When to Use Access Requests

Access Requests in Teleport can be used when engineers need to access
mission-critical computing resources such as:

- SSH servers
- Kubernetes clusters
- PostgreSQL or MySQL databases
- Internal web applications, such as monitoring dashboards, ticketing systems, etc.

Access requests can be used in the command line as shown above, or via a web
UI. Access requests elegantly address the contradiction between developer
productivity, security and compliance. In everyday use, they indeed feel very
similar to git pull requests — but for infrastructure access.
