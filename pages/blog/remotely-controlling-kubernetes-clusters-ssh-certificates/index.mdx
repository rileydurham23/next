## Introduction

In this post, we’ll cover how we leverage SSH certificates to access
remote infrastructure, securely. This should be interesting to you if:

- You are a software company that wants to deploy and remotely update your
  multi-server app on customer’s infrastructure or across multiple regions.
- You are a managed service provider (MSP) managing infrastructure for your
  customers.

The same approach can be used on any clusters of infrastructure - there’s
nothing specific to Kubernetes (aka, "k8s") here. We hope to inspire readers to
consider adopting a solid SSH framework for their organization, taking our
approach of managing k8s clusters for our customers as an example.

_This is part 1 of a multi-part series on how we remotely manage our customers’
Kubernetes clusters. Internally, we use
[Teleport](https://goteleport.com/), to automate many of the details
we will be discussing. Teleport is open sourced and you can find more
information on its website or Github [repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport)._

## Problem: Managing secure access

K8s itself offers a fairly robust (and growing) set of auth methods for the
users of its API, so the identity management within Kubernetes is not a
problem.

The problem is what's underneath.

The _infrastructure_ Kubernetes itself runs on must be managed as
too. We needed a simple and flexible access control layer for the ops
engineers who manage upgrades and health of k8s clusters. We also needed it
work across multiple regions owned by different companies. We saw two
challenges here:

1. How to manage our employees’ identities across many locations and many
   customers. For example, if one of our engineers is responsible for maintaining
   a k8s cluster on the AWS accounts of companies A and B, how do we automatically
   revoke access to the servers owned by companies A and B while (s)he’s on
   vacation?

2. How to provide unified connectivity to every region, including private data
   centers or colocation environments behind firewalls.

Let’s start with secure access and identity management.

## Traditional Solution: Using Secure Shell (SSH) keys

SSH is the ubiquitous access layer for managing UNIX servers and the most
commonly accepted method of SSH authentication involves distributing employees’
public SSH keys to servers.

In a key-based authentication scenario, a server only trusts clients whose
public keys it knows ahead of time, most likely because someone pre-loaded them
into ~/.ssh directories.

This is not optimal because:

1. Key distribution becomes a burden. It is common to see companies running
   production servers with obsolete keys or not having a key when someone new
   joins the team.
2. Implementing key rotation is not easy, yet everyone knows they need key
   rotation. How else would you make sure that a former employee’s public key
   disappears from all the servers it had been previously distributed to?
3. Restricting employees to groups of servers (or infrastructure regions)
   becomes complex: you will need an external key-management service.
4. There is no introspection and no single source of truth: you cannot easily
   tell who has access to what.
5. Implementing access-by-schedule or restricting users to specific OS logins
   (roles) like “root” requires additional complexity.

These problems can be solved by using [certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate).

## Alternative Solution: Using SSH with certificates

In a certificate-based system, servers do not keep public keys of the trusted
clients. Instead, they only keep the public key of the Certificate Authority
(CA) they trust.

In principle, a CA is nothing more than another public/private key pair. But a
CA has a special magic power: it can “sign” other public keys using its own
private key. The output of signing is called a certificate.

```text
Certificate = Client Public Key + CA Signature + Expiration Date + Metadata
```

It is impossible to change anything inside a certificate. If attackers try to
swap the public key or the metadata, they’ll invalidate the signature. In turn,
the signature cannot be forged without knowing the private key of the CA that
issued the certificate.

An SSH server will accept the certificate only if:

1. It trusts the CA which signed it by validating the signature using the CA’s
   public key.
2. The certificate is not expired.

You can probably see where this is going: the power of granting access has now
shifted from a server to the certificate authority (CA). Authentication now
happens in two stages: first, when a client requests a certificate (by having
its key signed). Second, when the generated certificate is presented to a
server.

This elegantly solves the problem of key distribution because keys are replaced
by dynamically issued certificates. This scheme has additional advantages:

- Administration of a certificate-based SSH system is greatly simplified: only
  the CA needs to know the access policies.
- You can issue short-lived certificates and enforce access according to a
  schedule. For example, users automatically lose access when they go on
  vacation or fall outside of pre-defined time intervals (assigned “shifts”).
- Auditing becomes much easier to implement.
- You can configure your servers to trust more than one CA, or perhaps trust
  them differently: this allows the establishment of trust between teams or
  server clusters owned by different organizations.

Another interesting feature of certificates is that they can include additional
metadata acting as instructions for the server: for example, a client can be
given a certificate which allows him to login as “darlene” but not as “elliot”
and definitely not as “root”. You can add your own metadata (extensions) for
policies like enforcing client connections only from a specific IP address.

### Example

Here is a sample certificate file which was generated
for the “vagrant” user of a virtual machine. To explore the contents you can
use the `ssh-keygen` command:

```text
$ ssh-keygen -L -f vagrant.cert
vagrant.cert:
        Type: ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com user certificate
        Public key: RSA-CERT SHA256:n1ieycXqpktoFjk8brvKf+f5/tQblNF88wJBPrmaFe8
        Signing CA: RSA SHA256:LqeiRCGsf+aGfzPM762vzch7GmEpnatnn+rKOZ6o+FI
        Key ID: "vagrant"
        Serial: 0
        Valid: before 2016-12-31T23:59:59
        Principals:
                vagrant
                elliot
        Critical Options: (none)
        Extensions:
                permit-pty
```

As you can see, this certificate allows the client to login as either “vagrant”
or “elliot”. When a client logs in, he can request a PTY (console), but cannot
do other things, like forward TCP ports...and access is denied completely at
the end of 2016.

### How does a CA trust clients?

You may be wondering how a certificate authority knows to trust a client and
issue it certificates. Typically you want the CA to be integrated with an
existing identity solution within your organization, like Active Directory,
LDAP or Google Apps.

This way, depending on which group a connecting client belongs to, it can be
issued a role-defined certificate with flexible permissions, an expiration date
and custom metadata. That opens up a lot of interesting possibilities!

### To be continued...

In the next post in our series, we’ll take a look at how to integrate
certificate authorities with existing identities in your organization and how
to build secure authentication themes that are easy to implement and reason
about.
