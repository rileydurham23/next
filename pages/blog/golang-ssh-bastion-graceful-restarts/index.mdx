## Introduction to Graceful Restarts

Being able to deploy a new version of your application or change its configuration in place without downtime has become table-stakes for
modern systems software. This post discusses the different approaches that can be taken to gracefully restart an application along with a
functional standalone sample to dig into the details. For those not familiar with Teleport, it's our [SSH and Kubernetes PEM
solution](https://goteleport.com/) designed for elastic infrastructure written in Go. This post should be interesting to developers and SREs that build
and maintain services written in Go.

## Background on SO_REUSEPORT vs Duplicating Sockets

Continuing our work in making Teleport highly available, we recently spent some time investigating how to gracefully restart Teleportâ€™s TLS
and SSH listener [in GitHub issue #1679](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/1679). Our goal was to be able to upgrade a Teleport
binary without having to take an instance out of service.

The two common approaches are covered by Marek Majkowski in his blog post [Why does one NGINX worker take all the
load?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-sad-state-of-linux-socket-balancing). To recap the approaches are:

- You can set `SO_REUSEPORT` on the socket to allow multiple processes to bind to the same port. With this approach you have multiple accepts queues feeding multiple processes.
- You can duplicate the socket and pass it as a file to a child process and then re-create the socket in the new process. With this approach you will have a single accept queue feeding multiple processes.

During our initial discussions several negatives came up about `SO_REUSEPORT`. One of our engineers had previously used that approach and
noticed that due to its multiple accept queue approach sometimes pending TCP connections could be dropped. In addition when we were having
these discussions, Go did not make it easy to set `SO_REUSEPORT` on a `net.Listener`. However, it should be noted that within the past few
days there has been movement on this issue and it looks like [Go will support setting socket options
soon](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9661).

The second approach was also appealing due to its simplicity plus being the traditional Unix fork/exec spawning model that most developers
are familiar with, the convention where all open files are passed to the child process. One thing to note, the `os/exec` package actually
does not allow this. Most likely for safety reasons, it only passes `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` to the child process. However the `os`
package does have lower level primitives that can be used to pass a file to a child process, and that's what we do.

## Using Signals to Switch Socket Process Owner

Before getting into the source, it's worthwhile providing some more details on how this approach works.

Starting a fresh Teleport process causes it to create a listener socket that receives all inbound network traffic on the assigned ports. For
Teleport this is TLS and SSH traffic. We added a signal handler for
[SIGUSR2](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Kill-Example.html) which causes Teleport to duplicate the listener socket then
spawn a new processes which is passed both the listener socket (as a file) and the metadata about the socket in its environment variables.
Once the new process starts, it re-creates the listener socket from the passed-in file and metadata, and starts processing traffic as it
gets it.

It should be noted that when a socket is duplicated inbound traffic is round-robin load balanced between the two sockets. As can be seen in
Figure (1), this means for a period of time both Teleport processes will be accepting new connections.

  _Figure 1: Teleport can duplicate itself and share traffic with the duplicate
  process._

Shutdown of the parent process is the same affair but in reverse. Once a Teleport process receives SIGQUIT it will begin the shutdown process: it stops accepting new connections, waits for all existing connections to be drained or for some timeout to occur. Once traffic has cleared, the dying parent will close its copy of the listener socket and exit. Now the kernel will only send traffic to the new process.

  duplicated._

## Sample Graceful Restart Walk-through

We wrote a small application that uses this approach that you can try yourself. The source code is at the bottom of this post, and you can try it out with the following commands:

First build and start the program.

```
$ go build restart.go
$ ./restart &
[1] 95147
$ Created listener file descriptor for :8080.

$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello
Hello from 95147!
```

Send the USR2 signal to the original process. Now when you hit the HTTP endpoint, it will return the PID of two different processes.

```
$ kill -SIGUSR2 95147
user defined signal 2 signal received.
Forked child 95170.
$ Imported listener file descriptor for :8080.

$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello
Hello from 95170!
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello
Hello from 95147!
```

Kill the original process and you will only get responses from the new PID.

```
$ kill -SIGTERM 95147
signal: killed
[1]+  Exit 1                  go run restart.go
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello
Hello from 95170!
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello
Hello from 95170!
```

Finally kill the new process and nothing will respond.

```
$ kill -SIGTERM 95170
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8080: Connection refused
```

## Conclusion and Sample Source Code

As you have seen, once you understand how it works, adding graceful restarts to services written in Go is fairly easy and greatly improves
the experience of the consumers of your services. If you'd like to see this in action with Teleport, we invite you to take a peek at our
reference [AWS SSH and Kubernetes bastion deployment](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/aws) which includes an
ansible script that leverages in-place graceful
restarts for upgrading Teleport binaries without
downtime.
