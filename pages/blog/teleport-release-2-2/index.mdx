Today we are officially releasing [version
2.2](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/releases) of [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/). We'd
like to thank the community and our growing customer base for their valuable
feedback and support of Teleport. We are also excited to publish an updated security
audit of the Teleport code performed by folks at [Cure 53](https://cure53.de/).

But first, let's start with some quick stats on the Teleport [Github repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport)
as of 06/13/2017:

- Over 5,000 Github Stars
- Over 2,771 commits from 36 contributors

## What is Teleport?

Teleport is a modern SSH server designed for teams managing distributed
infrastructure. The most popular Teleport features are:

- Certificate-based SSH: no need to distribute SSH keys.
- Teleport makes behind-firewall / cross-region SSH easy with automatic SSH jump-hosts.
- Strong audit capabilities including session recording & replay.
- Built-in 2nd factor authentication.
- Beautiful Web UI.
- Integration with SAML & OpenID Connect providers like Okta, Active Directory, Auth0, etc (Teleport Enterprise version only)
- SSH role-based access control / RBAC (Teleport Enterprise version only)

## What's new in 2.2?

### HTTP proxy support

It is now possible to run behind-firewall Teleport clusters that are forced to
tunnel all connections via an HTTP proxy set in `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`
environment variables. See more here: [#860](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/860)

The use case for this is when you have a group of servers located in a
locked-down enterprise environments (possibly controlled by enterprise IT)
where all servers are forced to go via an HTTP proxy when talking to the
outside world (public internet). If you need to remotely manage such cluster via SSH,
Teleport proxy (SSH jump host) will now look for `xxx_proxy` environment
variables and will establish an outgoing SSH tunnel going through HTTP proxy.

### ARM

We have been happily running Teleport on our Raspberry Pi test cluster for over
a year now. Due to the popular demand, we have decided to start officially
publishing ARM binaries with our releases and we're adding ARM platform to the
list of supported platforms for Teleport Enterprise.

For those building Teleport from source, the official way to bake an ARM
executable is to build on ARM. We do not use cross-compiling at the moment, so:

1. Get yourself an ARM box. Raspberry Pi 3 would do. We like hosted ARM servers
   from [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/) but hear
   that folks [Packet](https://metal.equinix.com/) have
   something even beefier.
2. Get [Golang 1.8.3 for ARM](https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.8.3.linux-armv6l.tar.gz).
3. Build as usual:

   ```bash
   $ git-clone git@github.com:gravitational/teleport.git
   $ cd teleport
   $ make release
   ```

### Client Improvements

- For some folks, `tsh ssh` meant twice as much typing than `ssh`. Now, if you
  rename `tsh` binary to `ssh` (or if you make a symlink `ssh -> tsh`) you can
  skip typing `tsh` and use familiar SSH syntax like `ssh user@host`. This also
  makes it easier integrating with Ansible, since you can now easily configure
  Ansible for Teleport by setting its ssh-executable setting.

- Another nice addition is the support for `-i` flag. This is useful for
  authenticating SSH robots who cannot (obviously) answer 2FA challenge or go
  via SAML endpoint. First, you can generate an identity file using `tctl`
  tool, and then you can pass it via `-i` flag to `tsh ssh` like this:

  ```bash
  # do this once on the Teleport auth server:
  $ tctl auth sign --user=joe > joe.pem

  # now you can use joe.pem to authenticate as joe:
  $ tsh -i joe.pem ssh host
  ```

- Starting with 2.2 `tsh` now supports per-user environment files, similar to
  `ssh`. If you create an environment file on a server in `~/.tsh/environment`
  it will be applied to your SSH sessions. The format of that file is the same
  as the output of `env`.

### Server Improvements

Teleport 2.2 allows you to **restrict ciphers, key exchange algorithms and MACs**
to your own subset. Teleport is based on Golang's implementation of SSH,
which we always felt provided secure defaults, but enterprise Teleport users
needed a way to hand-pick which ciphers are allowed.
With 2.2 this is [now possible](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1062).

We have also significantly improved interoperability with OpenSSH, including:

- Using the same file format for exporting cluster certificates.
- Compatible `scp` behavior between OpenSSH clients and Teleport servers.
- Compatible [keep alive](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/963) message processing.

## New in Enterprise 2.2

Enterprise edition of Teleport also gained a couple new features:

- [Full support for SAML 2.0](https://goteleport.com/docs/)
- **Role mapping for Trusted Clusters**. For example if you have two organizations,
  say "EU" and "US" and you have SSH roles defined inside of each, you can map
  users of a role of the EU cluster to another role inside the US cluster and vice versa.
  It is possible to say that US-based role "admin" automatically becomes
  "guest" if a user connects to the EU cluster. This allows to create flexible
  [RBAC-driven](https://goteleport.com/features/) policies in environments where outsourced IT (or external vendor
  support) need to securely access a subset of your infrastructure.

that have been addressed during 2.2 release cycle.

## Security Audit

Last year before the release of Teleport 1.0, we hired a well known security
consultancy to audit the Teleport code base so we could be confident calling
Teleport 1.0 a production ready release. While we were incredibly satisfied
with the work, we could not publicly publish the results. When we were
discussing the release of Teleport 2.0, being able to publicly release the
results of the latest security audit was one of the top requirements for the
next audit because we wanted to increase transparency around Teleport security.

That's why decided to use [Cure 53](https://cure53.de/). They have done impressive work auditing software like `Dovecot` and `ntp` as part of
[Mozilla's Secure Open Source initiative](https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS/Secure_Open_Source/Completed) and they
also publish the results openly.

We started the engagement with Cure53 in late April as we were preparing the major changes in 2.x series of Teleport.
We worked together to identify and patch all issues as they were found and released
[released Teleport 2.0.5](https://goteleport.com/blog/teleport-2.0.5-security-fixes/) as they
completed the audit. Now with the release of Teleport 2.2.0, which contains all
the security fixes in addition to additional features, we're also releasing the full report from Cure 53.

[You can download the full report from Cure 53 here](https://cure53.de/pentest-report_teleport.pdf).

With two professional security audits and thousands of OSS adopters performing
their own independent analysis, we continue to be confident in recommending
Teleport for production use.

## Upgrading

Teleport 2.2 is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the 2.x series. However, it is always
recommended to make a backup of the cluster state prior to replacing the
`teleport` binary with a new version. The cluster state is located in
`/var/lib/teleport` directory for filesystem-based deployments. Users of the `etcd` backend
should use `etcdctl backup` command to accomplish this.

## More info

For more information about Teleport, you can take a look at the
[documentation](https://goteleport.com/docs/getting-started/) or the
[overview](https://goteleport.com/). It is open sourced so
feel free to dig in - issues and/or pull requests are welcome. Also, feel free to
reach out via email if you have additional questions: [info@goteleport.com](mailto:info@goteleport.com).
