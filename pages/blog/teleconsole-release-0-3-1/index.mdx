We have received a lot of great feedback since the [Teleconsole
launch](https://github.com/gravitational/teleconsole/). We pushed a [quick update to
Github](https://github.com/gravitational/teleconsole/releases/tag/0.3.1) which
incorporates some of the feedback. This release is a quick response to most
common complaints and feature requests we've received since the original
release.

## New Features

- Reduced latency for non-US users: we've added a couple of proxy servers in
  Europe and Asia.
- Ability to create sessions shared only with specific SSH keys, including
  Github usernames. For example: `teleconsole -i torvalds`

Will create a session that only Linus will be able to join ;)

## Bug Fixes

Upon joining a new session, Teleconsole now replays up to 20 most recent
"drawings" so you get the full context of what you're looking at.

## Known Issues

Cross-compiling for ARM-6 is more trouble than it's worth, from now on ARM
builds are ARM-7 (Raspberry Pi 3+) but if you have an older ARM-6 based
appliance, building from source natively on it is trivial.

## Installing

If you haven't tried [Teleconsole](https://github.com/gravitational/teleconsole/) before,
get it:

```bash
curl https://www.teleconsole.com/get.sh | sh
```

And then simply type `teleconsole` in your terminal and follow the instructions.
