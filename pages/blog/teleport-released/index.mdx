### Today is a big day!

We are ecstatic to announce the 1.0 release of [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/). For the uninitiated, Teleport is
modern SSH server designed for clusters of servers and the teams working on
them. The notion of "cluster" and cluster membership is central to Teleport:
users can explore the nodes in a cluster, their user permissions are governed
on a cluster level, etc.

You can think of Teleport as a set of enhancements to SSH, while still being
backward compatible with OpenSSH. These enhancements include:

- Certificate-based authentication to avoid key distribution headaches.
- Built-in session recording/replay for sharing knowledge and security audits.
- Built-in reverse tunneling for connecting to clusters located behind firewalls.
- 2nd factor authentication and identity integration with Google Apps or any other OAuth2 provider.
- Real-time session sharing.
- Dynamic node labeling.
- Web browser based GUI (in addition to the CLI).

Since we open sourced Teleport in March, the
[repo](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) has received over 750 stars
on Github and has been downloaded or forked over 800 times. A number of
companies reached out to us helping with finalizing Teleport feature set,
testing and providing feedback.

The outcome of this process is finally here. Here is what's new in the 1.0 release.

### Security Audit Complete

The biggest news is that we have concluded a security audit of Teleport code
and penetration testing with a nationally recognized security consulting
company. We have addressed all of the concerns raised by the audit and we are
now comfortable recommending Teleport for production use.

### New Functionality

We've also exposed some additional functionality, including:

- [OpenID / OAuth2 integration](https://goteleport.com/docs/) and Google OpenID works out of the box.
- Multi-cluster connectivity with reverse tunnels for connecting
  behind-firewall environments ([Trusted
  Clusters](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/admin/#trusted-clusters)).
- Ability to use static tokens to [add nodes to a
  cluster](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/admin/#adding-nodes-to-the-cluster/).
- Ability to [revoke invitations](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/admin/#revoking-invitations/) to join the cluster.
- TSH `log out` command, which clears temporary keys.
- Account locking after a configurable amount of unsuccessful login attempts.

### Who is Teleport For?

Based on the market feedback, we have learned that Teleport's features are
especially appealing to teams of ops engineers who're responsible for managing
multiple pockets of infrastructure. Some examples:

- Managed service providers: ops teams who manage applications and
  infrastructure for their customers.
- SaaS companies: teams who have multiple environments distributed across
  staging/production and geographic dimensions like Teleport for managing trust
  across all these environments.
- Software vendors: they like Teleport for providing remote support of their
  products. Teleport can be used as a "remote control" to assist their
  customers with any issues of their software installed and running on-premises.
- Anyone else who likes having a beautiful Web UI to access their servers via SSH.

### Upgrading from Beta

Teleport YAML configuration format has changed slightly. Also, the format of
key and session storage has evolved, as well. We recommend beta users to wipe
out `/var/lib/teleport` directory on servers and `~/.tsh` directory on client
machines.

Moving forward, we are committed to backwards compatibility with configuration
files and on-disk data.
