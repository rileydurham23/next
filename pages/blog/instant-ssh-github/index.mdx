## Instant SSH Everywhere

Wouldn't it be great to allow a fellow developer to quickly and securely SSH into
your laptop when you're in the middle of a debugging session even if you are on two
separate networks behind NAT?

A few months ago we released a free tool, [Teleconsole](https://github.com/gravitational/teleconsole/), we built so we
could do exactly that. We are a distributed team, with bare metal servers sitting in our San Francisco
office, several AWS and Azure regions and a bunch of customer environments we are sometimes asked to
jump into.

[Teleconsole](https://github.com/gravitational/teleconsole/) makes it really easy to share a session: the inviting
party simply types the following into the terminal on any UNIX machine:

```bash
$ teleconsole
```

Which produces something like:

```bash
Your Teleconsole ID: 02f8cf345e9f00c1ee498ce410e8a2d10fb8a512
WebUI for this session: https://teleconsole.com/s/02f8cf345e9f00c1ee498ce410e8a2d10fb8a512
```

Then you can just share the Teleconsole ID to invite someone and they just have to type
the following to jump into your session:

```bash
$ teleconsole join 02f8cf345e9f00c1ee498ce410e8a2d10fb8a512
```

This is how we invite each other to any server or laptop. It works behind most firewalls without
messing around with VPNs.

Here's a short video showing how it works:

## Adding SSH Keys

This is great but it also means that anybody with this session ID can now join
your session.

This is not a concern for most situations: guessing the ID is pretty hard with
2^320 combinations. But what if someone attacks the channel you've shared the
session ID over or it otherwise falls into the wrong hands?!

Well, now you can pass an SSH public key to `teleconsole` as an argument
via `-i` flag, and only folks with a _corresponding private key_ will be able to
join.

To make it even easer (as suggested by the Teleconsole community) the public key
can be specified not only as a file but also as a Github handle! So you can do
both:

```bash
# use the public key stored in a file:
$ teleconsole -i kontsevoy.pub

# or you can use a public key of "kontsevoy" account on Github:
$ teleconsole -i kontsevoy
```

Either way, Teleconsole will give you a session ID to share that only
`kontsevoy` can use to join, because he has a private SSH key in his `~/.ssh`
directory which matches his public key:

```bash
$ teleconsole -i kontsevoy

Starting local SSH server on localhost...
Requesting a disposable SSH proxy on teleconsole.com for kontsevoy...
Checking status of the SSH tunnel...

Your Teleconsole ID: 8cbec01f330fb52aedff90e43db1c8bea2455cb6
WebUI is not available for key-restricted sessions
```

Teleconsole will make an API call to Github, request the public key of
`kontsevoy` and will configure your session to only let `kontsevoy` in and
nobody else. This way even if someone steals the session ID, they will not be
able to join because they donâ€™t have the private part of the key, only
`kontsevoy` has that.

Now `konstevoy` can join your terminal session using that `Teleconsole ID`, just as before:

```bash
$ teleconsole join 8cbec01f330fb52aedff90e43db1c8bea2455cb6

Teleconsole: joining session...
Matching key: /Users/ekontsevoy/.ssh/id_rsa

It's really that easy...

Thanks to Teleconsole users for this neat idea. Hope you enjoy!

## Tech behind Teleconsole

The [Teleconsole code](https://github.com/gravitational/teleconsole/) is on Github. Feel free to poke
around to understand how it works. It appears to be a tiny project, but only because it's standing on
the shoulders of giants, namely:

- Golang's excellent [SSH implementation](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh)
- [Teleport SSH Server](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) - our open
  source SSH server which enables on-the-fly SSH bastions, among other cool
  things.
