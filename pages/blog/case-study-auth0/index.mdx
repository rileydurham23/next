## Auth0 makes the internet safer

[Auth0](https://auth0.com) was founded in 2013 with a mission to make the internet safer. Today, Auth0 is about 500 employees strong and
manages over 2.5 billion logins per month. The company’s platform makes it easy for their customers to add authentication and authorization
services for web, mobile, and legacy applications.

The company offers public and private hosted editions of its flagship product. Auth0 was built around developers and makes it easy to add
authentication with just a couple lines of code. In the multi-tenant service, data is isolated and encrypted, but many customers opt to use
the private cloud instance on AWS, typically for compliance reasons.

## PCI and SSH compliance

Auth0 selected [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/) to provide secure access to their customers’ infrastructure, whether it’s hosted in a public or private
environment.

“It started because some customers wanted to have control over their infrastructure and didn’t want to allow anyone — even Auth0 — to have
access to their systems,” explained Pablo Terradillos, an applications engineer at Auth0 who works on the private SaaS engineering team.

Auth0 also had customers who had to address PCI compliance requirements. PCI requires companies
to host all infrastructure in isolated environments, so accessing those environments securely -- everything from initializing new services
to providing ongoing support -- was a challenge the Auth0 team needed to tackle.

Teleport is a secure, [SSH gateway](https://goteleport.com/how-it-works/) that gives users the ability to grant temporary access to infrastructure. It
has built-in role-based access control (RBAC) and automatically terminates sessions after a pre-defined period of time determined by the
customer. For Auth0, Teleport is used for customer support both in hosted and private environments.

  Teleport provided a secure, transparent and easy way to access to our customer
  environments. It helped our Managed Services Engineering Team to provide
  support 24x7 to our customers worldwide. We went from about 20 environments to
  over 120 in less than a year. - Pablo Terradillos, Applications Engineer,
  Auth0

## Open Source SSH gateway

The company initially discovered the open source community version of Teleport. Because it is open source, one of the first things they did
was add support for Auth0 directly into Teleport. “It was really helpful to have Teleport be open source. We actually authenticate into
Teleport using Auth0. It was easy to build that feature because Teleport already had support for OIDC.”

Auth0 uses RBAC (supported in Teleport) to ensure only the right support staff from the right teams are accessing the right customer
infrastructure as needed. Just as importantly, the only connection to the outside for customer infrastructure is provided by Teleport. It
ensures that Auth0’s support teams can provide troubleshooting when needed and not have to manage any SSH keys.

Teleport not only stores logs of every session, but records sessions for playback so users can see exactly what was done in each session.

“Having an audit of everything that’s going on is really useful. Some of our customers really value that and we like it, as well, to help us
understand what’s going on.” said Pablo. “If we see something wasn’t in the state it was supposed to be, we can look at the Teleport session
recordings.”

## Reliable and Scalable

In addition to the multi-tenant edition of Auth0, the team currently manages nearly 70 private instances for customers, each with at least 3
environments and up to 12 servers and each node is accessed through Teleport. As for working with Teleport, Pablo noted:

“We get a lot of support from your team. You’ve been very responsive. In fact, the last time I was in the Teleport support channel was to
add my new manager and someone from Teleport asked how everything was going. I said, well, there’s not much activity here in the support
channel, so that should tell you!”
