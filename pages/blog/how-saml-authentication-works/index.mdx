## What is SAML 2.0?

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is one of the most widely used open standard for authentication and authorizing between
multiple parties. It's one of the protocol that give users the single sign-on (SSO) experience for applications. The other adopted open
standard is [OAuth](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-oauth-authentication-works/) and
[OpenID](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-oidc-authentication-works/). Of the two, SAML 2.0, released in 2005, remains the 800 pound gorilla
in Enterprise SSO space. This post provides a detailed introduction on how SAML works

At its core, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is a means to
exchange authorization and authentication information between services. SAML is
frequently used to implement internal corporate [single sign-on (SSO)](https://goteleport.com/blog/kubernetes-sso-saml/) solutions
where the user logs into a service that acts as the single source of identity
which then grants access to a subset of other internal services.

The advantage of adopting SAML/SSO from a security perspective are clear:

- _Single source of identity_. When an employee joins or leaves a company,
  you don’t have to worry about the myriad of internal services that now have
  to be updated, and the ones that will inevitably be missed.
- _Enforce consistent authentication_. SAML/SSO can be used to enforce
  consistent method of authentication across all internal corporate services,
  like multifactor authentication and session duration.

This particular post will be focused on providing an overview of the how and
why of SSO and SAML.

## SAML Terminology

Unfortunately before going any further we have to define some SAML-specific
terminology, of which a fair amount exists.

### Principal

The _principal_ is the user trying to authenticate. You can think of this as
the actual human behind the screen, for the remainder of this post, we'll
assume it's John Smith.

It is helpful to think about principal having metadata attached to it. First
name, last name, email address, etc. This metadata is also called _identity
information_ and its importance will be explained below.

### Identity Provider

An _Identity Provider_, frequently abbreviated as `IdP`, is the service that
serves as the source of identity information and authentication decision. Think
of identity providers as databases for identity information.

Identity providers authenticate principals and return
identity information to <ins>service providers</ins> (see below). A few examples of common identity providers:
Auth0, Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), and Okta.

The industry best practice is to consolidate all user identities of an
organization in a single identity provider.

### Service Providers

_Service providers_ frequently abbreviated as `SP`, are the
services that are requesting authentication and identity information about the
principal. Service providers take authentication responses received from
identity providers and use that information to create and configure sessions.

In other words, a service provider is an application that offers a single sign
on (SSO) mechanism for its users to login and access its resources. Such
applications, in addition to knowing a principal name or email address may need
to request additional identity information about a principal, usually to implement
[role-based access control (RBAC)](https://goteleport.com/blog/access-controls/).

Examples of such applications include Github, Google Apps.
[Teleport](https://goteleport.com/), our SSH and Kubernetes access solution, is also a
service provider.

### Flows

SAML supports two different types of flows: those initiated by the service
provider and those initiated by the identity provider. In this post, we’ll
cover the common <ins>SP-initiated</ins>
flow. In SP-initiated flows, you start out at the service provider, are
redirected to the identity provider to authenticate, and are then redirected
back to the service provider.

This flow is usually initiated when a user clicks on "Login with SSO" button
or something similar.

### Bindings

_Bindings_ are the format in
which data is transferred between service providers and identity providers. The
two most popular are <ins>HTTP Redirect
Binding</ins> and <ins>HTTP POST
Binding</ins>. HTTP Redirect Bindings transfer data using HTTP redirects and
query parameters; this type of binding is typically used in authentication
requests. HTTP POST Binding transfer data using HTTP POST forms, this type of
binding is typically used in authentication responses.

In other words, bindings define _how_ the identity information about the
principal is communicated from an identity provider to a service provider.

### Assertions

_Assertions_ are statements made by the identity provider about the principal.
For example, the principal's email address and/or groups/roles the principal
may be associated with. Assertions are used by the service provider to create
and configure sessions for a principal.

In other words, assertions define _what_ identity information about the
principal is communicated from an identity provider to a service provider.

## SAML Login Flow

To illustrate how SAML Login works, we are going to use [Teleport](https://goteleport.com)
as an example of a service provider and [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for an
identity provider.

The SAML Login flow is shown on the diagram below:

<BlogImage src="./assets/saml-sso-teleport.png" />

1. A user clicks on "Login via Auth0" button, choosing to login via Auth0 using
   SAML, as opposed to using Teleport's built-in user database. Teleport
   redirects the user to Auth0. SAML authentication begins. We'll refer to the user
   as principal from now on.
2. Auth0 asks the user for their username or email, their password and the second
   factor (2FA) authentication token.
3. If the supplied information is correct, Auth0 takes principal's identity
   information and returns it back to Teleport as _assertions_.
4. Teleport receives the identity information from Auth0 and this allows it to
   create a user session.

### Configuration

Identity providers all have their own unique methods of configuration. However, the following minimal set of configuration is needed for the
identity provider to work with a service provider.

- An Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL has to be configured. The ACS URL is an endpoint on the service provider where the identity
  provider will redirect to with its authentication response. This endpoint should be an HTTPS endpoint because it will be used to transfer
  Personally Identifiable Information (PII). - Generate and upload a signing key to be used to sign authentication requests. More on this
  later. - Configuration of assertions, which includes information about the principal. The source and format of this information will need to
  be configured. At the minimum, the identity provider will send a NameID and some assertions about the principal (like group membership).

Service provider configuration is typically simpler, and can often by automatically configured by parsing metadata provided by the identity
provider. Simplified identity provider metadata XML is shown in Figure (2) below. The most important tags are `SingleSignOnService` and `KeyDescriptor`. The `SingleSignOnService` tags define the binding and endpoints to send authentication requests
to, and the `KeyDescriptor` tag contains the [public key](https://goteleport.com/blog/comparing-ssh-keys/) of the identity provider
which will be used to validate the authentication response.

### Authentication Request

To begin the login process, the principal typically will navigate to the service providers login page, and then click on a button that reads
something like, “Login via SSO.”

At this point the service provider will create an `AuthnRequest` XML document, serialize it (base64, compress, and URL
encode), add it as a query parameter to the URL, and redirect the principal’s browser to the identity provider’s login page. As the name of
the request implies, the service provider is requesting the identity provider to perform authentication on its behalf. It should go without
saying that this (and all other requests and responses) should occur over HTTPS.

The `AuthnRequest` is often sent using HTTP Redirect Binding, and ends up looking something like the following:

`https://idp.example.com/saml?SAMLRequest=nFdpk6JK0%2F0rHc7...`

Where the SAMLRequest parameter is the encoded `AuthnRequest`, a simplified `AuthnRequest` follows.

_Figure 3: Simplified authentication request sent by the service provider to the identity provider._

A few things to note about the `AuthnRequest`.

The service provider generates a large secure random number and inserts it into the `ID` field in the `AuthnRequest` tag. This value is also stored locally (typically in a database) and is
used to pair requests with responses from an identity provider and to prevent a malicious third party from sending an unsolicited response to a request (it would not know
the `ID`).

To prevent the re-use of expired `AuthnRequests`, the identity provider needs to store and track which `ID` values have been used thus far. Without some kind of time bound, this would
lead to the identity provider needing an ever increasing amount of storage. The `IssueInstant` is used to generate that validity window for the request.

The service provider should sign the `AuthnRequest`. The SAML signing scheme includes the signature, key used to sign
the request, and information on how to calculate the signature all under the `Signature` tag. The identity
provider should not only validate the included key was used to sign the request, but also that the key is the same as the one uploaded
during configuration (see previous section). If the key does not match, is missing, or if the signature values do not match, the identity
provider knows the request is not legitimate and to reject it. XML digital signatures, which is what SAML uses to sign requests, are a large
and complex topic in itself, [Signing an XML document using XMLDSIG](https://www.di-mgt.com.au/xmldsig.html) is a good place to start to
learn more.

### Authentication Response

Returning back to the authentication flow, at this point the principal is sitting at the login page of the identity provider. If the
principal enters their correct login credentials, the identity provider will perform a 302 Redirect to the ACS URL of the service provider
with body containing the authentication response. In the example we have been tracking, the ACS URL would look like the following:

```
https://sp.example.com/saml/acs
```

A simplified `SAMLResponse` would look like the following:

```

_Figure 4: Simplified authentication response sent by the identity provider to the service provider._

When a service provider receives an authentication response, it should first check if the `InResponseTo` attribute
references an `ID` of an `AuthnRequest` that the service provider actually sent. In
addition, the `IssueInstant` attribute should be used to scope the validity window of the response. The
reasoning for why these are important has already been explained in the previous section.

The ACS URL to which the authentication response is delivered performs no authentication of the client, this is why the `Signature` in the authentication response must be checked to ensure the client is
the identity provider. For readers familiar with the concept of webhooks, this is conceptually very similar: information is exchanged out-of-band ahead of time (often an API key in the case of webhooks) which is then used to authenticate the client.

The response also contains four new interesting tags: `Status`, `Subject`,

`Conditions`
, and `AttributeStatement:`

- The `Status` tag contains the authentication result: success or failure.
- `The Subject` tag identifies the principal that just authenticated. As seen in Figure
  (4), the `NameID` tag contains the email address of the principal that authenticated: `jsmith@example.com`.
- The `Conditions` tag defines constraints on the assertions, for example the `NotBefore` and `NotOnOrAfter` attributes define the time duration that the assertions are valid. This
  prevents a malicious actor from recording a valid authentication response and then replaying at a later time (perhaps after the principals account has been removed).
- The `AttributeStatement` tag contains assertions that the identity provider is making about the principal. As mentioned previously, assertions typically contain information like
  group membership within an organization, allowed logins, or any other relevant identifying information about the principal. In Figure (4), the principal is part
  of the groups `admins` and `developers` and is allowed to login as `root` and `jsmith`
  .

As mentioned above, it's important to keep in mind assertions about a principal
are a snapshot in time of identifying information. Providing long lived
assertions or sessions is, in general, a security risk. Keep assertions and
sessions reasonably short lived and force re-authentication to ensure that any
assertions that the identity provider made about the principal are still valid.

## Conclusion

What a service provider does with the response is up to the discretion of the
service provider. However, typically a successful response will create a
session on an internal service providing a single source of identity and
consistent authentication across internal services.

One common example is a service providers wanting to know which user group
a principal belongs to. This allows to implement role-based access control
policy, which says that only users from "SSH" group should be given access
to the production SSH environment. A different policy can be implemented for
accessing [Kubernetes clusters](https://goteleport.com/blog/microservices-containers-kubernetes/), or the CI/CD pipeline, etc.

Generally, SAML authentication solves three important problems:

- SAML offers significant improvement to user experience. Users only have to
  remember their credentials with a single identity provider and not having to
  worry about usersnames and passwords for every application they use.
- SAML allows application developers to outsource identity management and
  authentication implementation to external providers and not having to
  implement it themselves.
- And perhaps most importantly, SAML dramatically reduces the operational
  overhead of managing access within an organization. If an employee leaves or
  transfers to another team, their access will be automatically revoked or
  downgraded across all appliations connected to the identity provider.

Hopefully that provides a good snapshot of how SAML works. If you’d like to
