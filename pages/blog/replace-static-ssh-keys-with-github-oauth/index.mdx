## Introduction

Suppose you have 250 servers in your organization and 10% of them are not used
in production; you also have 15 people on your engineering team, with 5 of them
being contractors. How do you manage who gets SSH access to what...and how do
you deal with people joining and leaving the team or changing roles? And how do
you make sure a lost laptop doesn't lead to a larger compromise?

With the increasing frequency and severity of data breaches at companies like
Equifax, Yahoo, Target, and Uber, and larger amounts of data being dispersed
across cloud services, information security is top of mind for both large
enterprises and startups. Large companies like [Facebook](https://engineering.fb.com/2016/09/12/security/scalable-and-secure-access-with-ssh/), [Lyft](https://eng.lyft.com/blessing-your-ssh-at-lyft-a1b38f81629d) and [Netflix](https://speakerdeck.com/rlewis/how-netflix-gives-all-its-engineers-ssh-access-to-instances-running-in-production) often have the security teams and
resources to architect DIY solutions or purchase custom solutions to address
their concerns.

##### This blog post describes how to simply and effectively manage SSH credentials for smaller teams through their Github team membership using open source tools.

The management of SSH keys at a startup is often left up to the collective
responsibility of the engineering team. When that team is small and capable, it
may not a be an immediate problem. Yet, we are surprised how often we meet
teams who have a shared public key called something like `ops.pem` which gets
replaced and re-distributed every time the team changes...and usually someone
forgets to replace it at some point.

## SSH Certificates

This blog post offers a better way, based on two simple principles:

1. Your SSH infrastructure, instead of relying on forgotten artifacts on
   servers (public keys), should rely on an external identity system common
   for everyone in your organization.
2. Instead of SSH keys, use automatically expiring SSH certificates to grant
   someone access to a _subset of infrastructure for a limited amount of
   time_.

We are going to use [Teleport](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport), our open
source SSH server, to simplify the implementation. Starting in
version 2.4, Teleport supports Github authentication, which allows
administrators to grant SSH access to engineers who are members of a specified
Github team for an organization. With this setup, if someone leaves the organization and
they are removed from the Github team, their SSH access is removed, as well.

Another benefit of certificate-based authentication via Github is that users no
longer have to worry about having their private SSH keys compromised. The SSH
certificates used by Teleport automatically expire after a configurable amount
of time and to get a new one, users will have to go through Github
authentication, hopefully with [2FA](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/)
turned on.

## How does this work?

Let's take a look how this will work. The steps in the diagram are explained below:

<BlogImage src="./assets/github-auth.svg" />

This somewhat simplified login workflow works as follows:

1. When a user shows up for work in the morning, she needs to request a new
   certificate from the Teleport certificate authority (CA) for the day.
   Teleport offers a CLI command for this, `tsh login`.
2. The Teleport responds with a Github URL for the user to log in. Usually,
   a browser window will also open automatically.
3. The user goes through Github authentication, including 2FA enforcement if enabled.
4. If Github authentication succeeds, Teleport receives a secure token via
   HTTPS which allows it to retrieve the user's team membership information.
5. If the user is a member of the specified team, Teleport issues a certificate and
   stores it in the user's CLI environment. By default, the certificate is
   stored in `~/.tsh` and is valid for 8 hours but this ttl can be configured.

### Setup Teleport

First step is to install Teleport on your infrastructure. You can build it from
source if you have Go installed or you can download the latest binaries from
the [github repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport). You can read
about Teleport architecture in detail [here](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/architecture/),
but the basic Teleport deployment includes the following components:

1. _Teleport certificate authority_ (CA) also known as the _"auth server"_. This
   server will be issuing certificates for users.
2. _Teleport proxy_, also sometimes known as _"the bastion host"_. Access to all
   nodes in a Teleport cluster must be routed via a proxy. We believe it’s a
   solid security practice and Teleport makes it mandatory.
3. _Teleport nodes_. These are regular SSH servers, except they automatically
   configured to only trust users who present a valid, up to date certificate
   issued by the CA.

To make this tutorial easy to follow, we'll use a single-node Teleport cluster.
This node will run all 3 services at the same time. Github-based authentication uses
via [OAuth2](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/basics-of-authentication/) and
for it to work, the Teleport proxy must be externally accessible via a valid
HTTPS endpoint (we'll use `https://proxy.example.com:3080` here)

### Creating a Github Team

First, we need to create a team under your Github organization for users who
will be allowed to receive SSH certificates from Teleport. When logged into
Github, click on the "Teams" tab, create a team and add a few members
to it.

<BlogImage src="./assets/github-teams.png" />

Let's assume the organization is called "octocats" and the team is
called "teleport-ssh-users".

### Configuring Github OAuth

Next, visit the "Settings" tab on Github and select "OAuth Apps" on
the left-side menu. Click on "New OAuth App" and fill out the form.

Pay attention to "Authorization callback URL" set to
`https://proxy.example.com:3080/v1/webapi/github/callback` - your team members
must be able to access it via their browser.

<BlogImage src="./assets/github-oauth-app.png" />

Click on the "Register application" button and you will see a page which will contain
a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` which are needed for the next step: to
configure this integration on Teleport side.

### Configuring Teleport

First, update `/etc/teleport.yaml` configuration file to look like this:

```yaml
auth_service:
  enabled: yes

  # This line tells Teleport to use an authentication connector
  # called "github"
  authentication:
    type: github

proxy_service:
  enabled: yes

ssh_service:
  enabled: yes
```

Now, define a Github connector in a YAML file:

```yaml
# save this as github-connector.yaml:
kind: github
version: v3
metadata:
  # name of the connector must match the authentication type
  # in /etc/teleport.yaml
  name: github
spec:
  display: Github
  client_id: <client-id> # from Teleport OAuth app on Github
  client_secret: <client-secret> # from Teleport OAuth app on Github
  redirect_url: https://proxy.example.com:3080/v1/webapi/github/callback

  # This section says that anyone from 'teleport-ssh-users' team in
  # 'octocats' organization can SSH as root
  teams_to_logins:
    - organization: octocats
      team: teleport-ssh-users
      logins:
        - root
```

Now, lets create this connector via `tctl` command. This must be executed on
the Teleport auth server:

```bash
$ tctl create github-connector.yaml
```

## Trying it out

That's it. Now, assuming a user is a member of teleport-ssh-users team, he or
she can execute the following Teleport command to retrieve an SSH certificate:

```bash
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy.example.com
```

This will open a Github login flow through a browser. If a user is already
authenticated with Github (i.e. there’s an active cookie) the login process
will be instant. The SSH certificate will be stored in user’s `~/.tsh`
directory. To login into any SSH server inside a cluster:

```bash
$ tsh ssh --port=22 root@host.example.com
```

... or just `ssh root@host.example.com` if using OpenSSH client.

## Using OpenSSH?

While using `tsh` on a client and `teleport` daemon on servers has its
advantages, some users prefer to use Teleport strictly in a bastion/CA mode and
keep OpenSSH daemons running on their existing server fleets. Teleport can be
used with OpenSSH client as well. See [the documentation](https://goteleport.com/docs/server-access/guides/tsh/#using-openssh-client/)
to properly configure OpenSSH for this.

## What if Github is not accessible?

While Github is a reputable service, it is
not prudent to expect Github (or any web-hosted service) to be available 100%
of the time. In rare (and hopefully brief) situations when Github cannot be
used for authentication, you can fall back to local Teleport users by including the
`--auth=local` flag to `tsh login`. One way to do it is to have a special
"github-is-down" admin user which can get a certificate via:

```bash
$ tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --auth=local --user=github-is-down
```

Local authentication should also be used for issuing certificates for
automation/bots.

## Conclusion

In this post we covered how to replace static SSH keys scattered around your
infrastructure with SSH certificates issued dynamically based on a user's team
membership at Github. At this time, Github is the
only external identity supported by the open source edition of Teleport but
we offer a [self-hosted enterprise and cloud editions](https://goteleport.com/pricing/). They
both support providers like Okta, Active Directory, Auth0, Oracle IDM and others.

The commercial Teleport offering also supports robust [RBAC features for SSH](https://goteleport.com/teleport/features/rbac-for-ssh/),
like allowing administrators to grant more granular access to partitions of the
infrastructure to multiple teams.
