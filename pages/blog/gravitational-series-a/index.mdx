Today, we are proud to announce that we have closed a $25MM Series A funding round led by Kleiner Perkins.

In just a couple of years, our customer base has exploded from a handful of early adopters to an impressive portfolio of some of the world’s largest and most innovative companies, including NASDAQ, Splunk, TicketMaster, Mulesoft and Samsung.

While we were recently able to reach profitability by delivering valuable software solutions to our customers, this Series A financing provides us with even more resources to execute on the company’s vision faster. We will be accelerating our product development and making our products even more capable and easier to use. The additional funding will also allow us to build a world-class enterprise support organization to serve our customers better.

## Why we started Gravitational

We started Gravitational to empower software developers to deliver their cloud
applications to any infrastructure with the same simplicity as desktop and
mobile applications.

We have always loved the operational model of downloadable software from the
desktop era when applications did not have to be managed 24&#47;7. Compare that
to today’s era of cloud computing when software developers must closely work
with DevOps teams to constantly fight dozens of layers of complexity associated
with the modern cloud stacks. Some SaaS companies, even those with very capable
engineering teams, tend to lose the institutional knowledge of what it takes to
go from scratch to production over time. Even migrating from one AWS account
into another can be an Everest-sized obstacle for many teams.

Our open-source solution, [Gravity](https://goteleport.com/), gives
you the power to capture your entire production environment in a single file,
like a giant VM image, which you can drag and drop across cloud providers or
give it to your customers to run on their own, like a desktop app.

We also enable secure privileged access to these environments through our
modern secure access gateway, [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/gravity/),
which rejects the obsolete authentication mechanism based on SSH keys and
instead relies on certificates tied to user identity as the only method of
authentication and authorization for multi-cloud infrastructure.

  Teleport has made obtaining a FedRAMP-Moderate ATO that much more achievable
  via their FIPS 140-2 endpoints, ease in integration with our SSO and MFA, and
  the view into audit logs of remote connection sessions provide the appropriate
  insight for continuous monitoring. - Jeff Gill, Director of Engineering at{" "}

## Multi-Cloud and Open-Source

Building cloud software is hard. Despite the myriad tools available to
developers, the complexity of getting from idea to production is only growing.
The major cloud providers are increasingly offering services to help manage
this complexity and while they may help solve immediate problems, they create
lock-in to a particular provider. We believe cloud-native applications should
be unchained from the underlying compute infrastructure.

Gravity offers a completely different way of thinking about cloud computing.
**Instead of layering application dependencies on top of infrastructure, we
propose bundling all dependencies, even including things like SSH access, into
the application itself**, making it completely independent from a particular
infrastructure form factor or cloud provider.

This approach facilitates an ecosystem of open source solutions that are not
tied to any cloud provider but are still tightly integrated using open APIs and
open protocols.

We are not alone in this belief. Companies like GitLab share this vision of
multi-cloud computing based on open technologies.

  We believe multi-cloud is the future. GitLab is a complete DevOps platform,
  delivered as a single application that works with any cloud. GitLab enables
  workflow portability, so your process for developing, delivering, operating,
  and securing software stays the same regardless of which cloud you are running
  on. Gravity enables workload portability, so you can move your entire
  production environment anywhere you want. GitLab and Gravity work together to
  make multi-cloud a reality. - Sid Sijbrandij, co-founder and CEO of{" "}
