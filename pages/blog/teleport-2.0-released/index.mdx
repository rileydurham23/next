## What is Teleport?

Teleport is a modern SSH server designed for teams managing distributed
infrastructure. You can read more about Teleport on its
[website](https://goteleport.com/) or [online documentation](https://goteleport.com/docs/getting-started/).

## Who uses Teleport?

- Managed service providers: ops teams who manage applications and
  infrastructure for their customers.
- SaaS companies: teams who have multiple environments distributed across
  staging/production and geographic dimensions like Teleport for managing trust
  across all these environments.
- Software vendors: they like Teleport for providing remote support of their
  products. Teleport can be used as a "remote control" to assist their
  customers with any issues of their software installed and running on-premises.
- Enterprise IT departments: to enforce secure and consistent access patterns
  across their internal servers and cloud infrastructure.

## 2.0 Release Notes

The new features in Teleport 2.0 are:

- Native support for DynamoDB back-end for storing cluster state.
- It is now possible to disable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
- Support for Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP) for Two-Factor Authentication.
- New and easy to use framework for implementing secret storage plug-ins.
- Audit log format has been finalized and documented.
- Experimental simple file-based secret storage back-end.

Additional improvements:

- Improvements to OpenSSH interoperability including:
  - Host Certificates now contain DNS names as well as Teleport IDs.
  - Corrected export formats for Certificate Authorities.
  - `tsh login` and `tsh agent` now support loading keys into external SSH agents.
  - Improvements and fixes for Ansible integration.
- Server-side enforceable authentication.
- Enhanced [OIDC](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-oidc-authentication-works/) functionality to support parsing `UserInfo` for claims information.
- Friendlier CLI error messages.

### Teleport Enterprise

In addition to these improvements to the open source distribution of Teleport,
we are releasing a commercial version of Teleport, called Teleport Enterprise.
This commercial release will include features that make it easier for large organizations to manage Teleport, including:

- Role-based access control (RBAC).
- Integration with External Identity Providers.
- SSH agent forwarding
- Dynamic configuration, which gives you the ability to manage roles and trusted clusters at runtime.
- 24/7 Commercial Support.

### Upgrading

Teleport 2.0 is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the 1.x series. However, it is always
recommended to make a backup of the cluster state prior to replacing the
`teleport` binary with a new version. The cluster state is located in
`/var/lib/teleport` directory for filesystem-based deployments. Users of the `etcd` backend
should use `etcdctl backup` command to accomplish this.

### Security Audit Status

We are working with an independent auditor to conduct a security audit of
Teleport v2.0 and Teleport Enterprise and they will be publishing the resulting
audit in April 2017. The last audit we conducted was just prior to the release
of v1.0 so we believe it is prudent to conduct another audit at this time.
