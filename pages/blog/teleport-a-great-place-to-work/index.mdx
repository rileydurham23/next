August has been a great month for Teleport. Our [Series B round of funding](https://goteleport.com/blog/series-b/), led by Kleiner Perkins,
plus the arrival of [secure MongoDB access with Teleport 7.0](https://goteleport.com/blog/secure-access-mongodb/) is cause enough for celebration. In addition,
Teleport has been officially Certified™ by Great Place to Work &reg;. This prestigious certification is based entirely on feedback from
current employees; this year, an incredible 100% of our team members told us we are a great place to work. This is compared to 59% of
employees at a typical U.S.-based company. This is a huge achievement for our team, and reflects the time, focus, and resources we put
towards our employees.

## What does it mean to be certified as a great place to work?

Great Place to Work® is the global authority on workplace culture, employee experience, and the leadership behaviors proven to deliver
market-leading revenue, employee retention and increased innovation.

Great Place to Work Certification&trade; isn't something that comes easily. "It takes ongoing dedication to the employee experience," said
Sarah Lewis-Kulin, vice president of global recognition at Great Place to Work. "It's the only official recognition determined by employees'
real-time reports of their company culture. Earning this designation means that Teleport is one of the best companies to work for in the
country."

## Our commitment to company culture

Author Charles Simmons wrote, "true greatness consists in being great in little things" and here at Teleport we try to be intentional about
how many "little things" we can impact to create a positive experience for our team members. In reality, though, nothing is "little." They
are just individual components of the scope of our company's culture, values, and overall experience. Compensation, benefits, communication,
meeting culture, events, support, resources and much more are just some of those components.

At Teleport, we believe that our team members should have access to the resources and support they need to do their best work. In addition
to providing high-quality benefits (medical,vision, dental, etc.) and access to other support like mindfulness apps and generous
reimbursements for cell/internet, we also provide up to $7000 per year for each employee to make choices about what feels like support for
their wellness. Purchasing a Peloton or road bike, gym memberships, weekly therapy sessions, and guitar lessons are some of the choices that
our team members have made. How do our team members decide how to use these resources? It comes down to what they decide will help them be
better for themselves, for their family, and for work.

## Adjusting to a fully remote work environment

Responding to shifting dynamics and contexts is key to our intentional focus on culture. Before COVID-19 sent everyone home in March of
2020, we frequently ate lunch together in the office, had informal coffee breaks, and cleared out by 6pm every day. The clear work-life
balance was visceral for everyone working at one of our headquarters.

That changed suddenly with the onset of the pandemic, and we had to expand our understanding of what it meant to be engaged with 100% of our
employees working from home. This was a daunting task but also an important one as it challenged us to be more mindful of the experience of
our team members that were already working remotely across the US and around the world. Input from these team members was invaluable during
this transition.

Our ongoing effort includes a lot of trial and error. Zoom happy hours reached their engagement limit. Participation in game nights ebbed
and flowed (currently engagement is flowing). Virtual cooking classes have continued to be a strong connector. And we're continuing to
experiment as we go.

Two big principles help to drive our decision-making about culture:

1. Choice/flexibility
2. Trying things out

Shifting the decision-making to allow for organic development of events and groups has allowed for some incredible connections. Who could
have anticipated a socially distanced Miata Meetup in August?
