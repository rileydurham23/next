Today we are bumping the major version number of [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/)
to **3.0** and for good reason. One of our beta testing customers said it best:

<Quote>
  This is too easy, now I can now authenticate once and access both my
  Kubernetes clusters [via kubectl] and the underlying servers [via SSH]!
</Quote>

That's right, in addition to being an SSH gateway, Teleport now has native
support for Kubernetes. Before we cover this feature in greater detail, let's
introduce Teleport to the new readers of this blog.

## What is Teleport?

Teleport is a privileged access management system
for elastic _(and now Kubernetes)_ compute infrastructure.

Teleport delivers hardened DevOps &amp; SRE security best practices in a box to
companies who have traditionally relied on static keys or complex DIY SSH
bastion solutions.

By adopting Teleport in your organization you will:

- Secure its infrastructure and easily pass compliance requirements.
- Improve visibility into access and behavior across your infrastructure.
- Reduce the operational overhead of enforcing security best-practices.

Teleport allows low-level systems access to be controlled by _who the user is
within an organization_, not based on which private key they have.

Teleport is open source and compatible with OpenSSH clients and servers.

## Kubernetes Support

With the 3.0 release, Teleport can be configured as a compliance gateway for Kubernetes
clusters. This allows users to authenticate against a Teleport proxy using the
`tsh login` command and retrieve credentials for both SSH and the Kubernetes
API:

In the scenario illustrated above a user can execute the following command to log into Teleport:

```bash
# Authentication step to retrieve the certificates. tsh login places the SSH
# certificate into `~/.tsh` as usual and updates kubeconfig with Kubernetes
# credentials:
$ tsh --proxy=teleport.example.com login
```

They then receive the certificates that determine their access and permissions
for both SSH and Kubernetes:

```bash
# Execute SSH commands to access SSH nodes:
$ tsh ssh login@ssh-node

# Execute any kubectl commands to access the Kubernetes cluster:
$ kubectl get pods
```

In other words, a Teleport Proxy can now become a single authentication
endpoint for both SSH and Kubernetes. This brings the following advantages to Teleport users:

- Users authenticate against a Teleport proxy once and retrieve credentials for
  both SSH and Kubernetes API.
- Users' RBAC roles are always synchronized between SSH and Kubernetes, making
  it easier to implement policies like developers must not access production
  data.
- Teleport session recording and the audit log extend to Kubernetes, as well.
  Regular kubectl exec commands are logged into the audit log and the
  interactive commands are recorded as regular sessions, which can be stored
  and replayed in the future.

### Better compliance

The unified authentication and audit logging for both SSH and Kubernetes is not
merely a convenience feature. It also gives organizations a simple way to
reason about their infrastructure security and a single gateway to enforce
compliance across traditional and newer, cloud native infrastructure management
tools.

Often "compliance enforcement" initiatives bring a fair amount of disruption
and inconveniences to day-to-day operations, making it harder for engineers to
do their jobs. Teleport, however, stays true to its promise of getting out of
the way. Developers can continue to enjoy using familiar commands like `ssh`
and `kubectl` without having to worry about bastion hosts and complicated
authentication mechanisms. This reduces the incentives to go around compliance
policies.

### How does it work?

When a user executes the `tsh login` command, they specify a Teleport proxy
which asks the Teleport auth server to authenticate (usually via corporate SSO)
and issue an SSH certificate which is returned to the user.

The SSH certificate is later used to implement end-to-end encryption between a
user and an SSH node.

The Kubernetes integration is turned off by default but when **turned on**, the
Teleport auth service also retrieves a Kubernetes certificate using the
[Kubernetes CSR API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/)
which is kept in memory for the user's session.

When a user issues the `kubectl exec` command, it is sent to a Teleport proxy, which
updates the audit log and performs the recording of interacive sessions, and
user requests are forwarded to the Kubernetes endpoint using the previously
issued certificate.

You can dig deeper by taking a look at the relevant sections in the
[architecture document](https://goteleport.com/docs/architecture/overview/#kubernetes-integration)
and the [admin manual](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/admin/#kubernetes-integration).

Here is a quick 3 minute demo of the end user's experience.

## Other Improvements

As usual, the full list of improvements and bugfixes can be found on [Github](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/24?closed=1).

You can also glance at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/9a7a801d5d9fd813a9e9846a359f30b619570d64/CHANGELOG.md)
for a quick overview. A few improvements are worth mentioning here:

- Teleport administrators can now fine-tune the enabled ciphersuites [#1999](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1999)
- We have documented the previously undocumented monitoring endpoints [#2103](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2103)
- The arbitrary limit of how many trusted clusters can be used behind an SSO has been removed. [#2192](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2192)

### Upgrading Teleport

**Warning:** if you are using the `etcd` backend for Teleport, you must make sure
your `etcd` version is 3.0 or newer prior to upgrading. Teleport 3.0 drops the
legacy (v2.x) etcd API support.

As usual, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the [recommended upgrade procedure](/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport)
before upgrading to this version.
