Today we are announcing the release 3.2 of Teleport, the open
source [privileged access management (PAM) solution](https://goteleport.com/).

## What is Teleport?

Teleport is a modern, cloud-native PAM, designed for distributed teams running
applications on distributed infrastructure. This means that Teleport users
can remotely access any servers or VMs of their organization, from any device,
from any location, regardless with cloud a server is located in, including
behind-NAT environments, without the need for VPN.

The hallmark features of Teleport are:

- Built-in proxy (sometimes called jump host) with support for SSH and Kubernetes API.
- Certificate-based SSH authentication with auto-expiring certificates: this
  removes the need to “manage” SSH keys.
- Robust audit capabilities including a unified audit log, the session recording & replay.
- Built-in 2nd-factor authentication.
- Works with a CLI client and Web UI.
- Single sign-on (SSO) for SSH and Kubernetes (community supports github SSO; enterprise version supports corporate idenity managers).
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for SSH (enterprise version only).

information.

## AWS EKS Bastion Host Support

The major new feature of this release is full support for Amazon Elastic
Container Service for Kubernetes (AWS EKS). Prior to 3.2, Teleport has been
relying on a [CSR API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/#requesting-a-certificate)
to issue certificates for Kubernetes users. Unfortunately, EKS never supported CSR.

In this version, we are switching to the [Impersonation API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#user-impersonation),
which allows RBAC to be set up in a more fine-grained way allowing Teleport to
only assume identities with limits, as shown in the example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: limited-impersonator
rules:
  # Can impersonate the groups "developers" and "admins" only
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["groups"]
    verbs: ["impersonate"]
    resourceNames: ["developers", "admins"]
```

## Why Support Bastions for AWS EKS?

Many of Teleport customers are using Kubernetes across multiple clouds, like AWS
EKS, Google’s GKE and Microsoft's AKS.

An average organization uses 5 different infrastructure form-factors today, and
developers need to be productive across all of them. Yet, they face the
following challenges:

### Identity Fragmentation

Every public cloud provider wants its users to be locked into a provider’s IAM
when using Kubernetes. Meanwhile, most users are already using and quite happy
with identity providers of their choice (e.g. Auth0, Okta or NetIQ) and would
like to continue doing so.

Teleport has been offering an elegant way to provide SSH access across all
clouds to all approved employees, but with this release, we are finally
extending these powerful features to all major Kubernetes vendors. This greatly
reduces the operational overhead of managing access, allows customers to enforce
compliance using a single pane of glass, and increases visibility into
distributed infrastructure.

### Compliance-friendly control plane

With many clusters across distributed infrastructure, there is a need to reduce
the surface area of attack by avoiding exposure of the Kubernetes API directly to the
internet and aggregating all access through a single highly
available entry point (aka, a "Bastion" or "Jump Host").

Teleport 3.2 makes it easy to achieve that by connecting all clusters using
Teleport’s trusted clusters feature.

Also, with the 3.2 release, administrators gain additional controls to terminate
idle long-running connections to the clusters, a feature required by customers
going through compliance audits.

## Upgrading

Teleport 3.2 is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the 3.x series. (If you're not already using
Teleport, you can [download the open source edition](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download) or get a demo of [Teleport Enterprise](https://goteleport.com/pricing/)). However, if your Teleport cluster already has Kubernetes integration turned on, you will
need to update `/etc/teleport.yaml` configuration file for the proxy service:

- `kubeconfig_file` setting has been moved from `auth_service` section under
  `proxy_service/kubernetes` section.

You can see the full list of changes in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
