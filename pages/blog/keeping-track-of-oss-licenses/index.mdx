## Introduction

A few weeks ago we attended a dinner hosted by Lightspeed Ventures for
technology leaders in the Bay Area. At the event, someone proposed
that each guest share a simple (but useful) bit of advice for other tech
companies in the enterprise software space.

One of the wisest bits of advice was:

<Quote>
  Get your software licenses in order EARLY and save yourself from a world of
  pain later.
</Quote>

Indeed. This is a lesson we had also previously learned. In this post
I'll share our experience heeding this advice with our quickly evolving codebase.

## TLDR;

- "FOSS" is free, but has implicit costs.
- This "cost" usually comes up at the most critical times, like an acquisition offer or large customer deal.
- Review all licenses before using - tell your team to do the same.
- If you have not been actively doing this, [here's a script to scan and categorize them](https://github.com/gravitational/licensinator).
- If there are any [copyleft licences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft), be especially vigilant.
- Talk to a lawyer to make sure you are not infringing on other's rights.

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

All of us in the software business owe a lot to our predecessors. The amount of
free and open-source software ("FOSS") code that can be leveraged when building
a new offering is staggering. From a simplistic (and perhaps cynical)
perspective, many SaaS products can be thought of as:

`SaaS = dash of business logic code + tons of existing FOSS + ops blood, sweat and tears`

However, while all of that FOSS you are using may be free (monetarily), there
could be implicit costs. This post will touch on what to watch out for and tips
for keeping your code base clean, legally.

## Open source != public domain

As a startup, it may be tempting (while you are rapidly moving around, breaking
things) to pay little heed to the types of FOSS you are using. However, just
because something is open source does not mean it is free for you to use, willy
nilly. Those licenses that are included with each FOSS library matter and they
REALLY matter at the most crucial times...like being acquired or signing a
large deal.

The likelihood of this becoming a problem is correlated with your success and
notoriety, so many startups do not focus on this when they are just getting
started.

But imagine spending several years toiling away at your startup and against all
odds you build it into something that someone else actually wants to buy...yay!
Well, the acquirer will do several types of due diligence before writing that
check, one of which is intellectual property due diligence. As part of that due
diligence, if they find you are infringing on someone else's rights, they will
tell you that they can not buy your company while you are doing that. It would
be a huge bummer to have something as banal as this scuttle the deal.

## IANAL, you should talk to a lawyer

Before we get into it, the first obvious piece of advice is to talk to your
lawyer (I am not a lawyer). Unfortunately, lawyers can be pretty expensive so
many people will put it off until it's too late. _Do not do that._ Treat this
post as some free, amateur advice to help you engage with your lawyer in a more
educated manner.

I won't go into the intricacies of software licensing but here are a few tips,
links and tools to help you get started.

## General overview of FOSS

Software licenses evolved out of copyright law and in particular the
protections that an author has to his or her original works. This incentivizes
people to spend their precious time creating cool stuff...because then they own
it. Software is classified under literary works since you are, in fact, writing
that code. The main protection authors have is that they get to determine how
they distribute their works to other people and what those other people can do
with them. The license is the document that tells others what they can do with
the author’s work.

In the software world, most of the open source licenses you will encounter are
[Permissive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_licence) or
[Protective/Copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft).

This is a massive over simplification so here are some resources to learn more:

- [A good trail head for your Wikipedia journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_license)
- [An awesome reference of most software licenses and what you need to worry about in plain english](https://tldrlegal.com/)
- [A list of the most popular software licenses](https://www.blackducksoftware.com/top-open-source-licenses)

Most permissive licenses let you use and redistribute the code freely (with
some having a requirement that you reference the original copyright). A
Copyleft license will have additional requirements, a common one being that you
have to use that same license to distribute what it is included with. For this
reason, Copyleft licenses are sometimes pejoratively referred to as viral
licenses since they infect and limit how you can license the resulting code
base. Out of the top five most popular licenses, the GNU licenses are Copyleft
licenses.

The main takeaway is that if you want to sell your software or even open source
it, you may be infringing on the original author's rights if you have are using
any software with a Copyleft license.

So, here are some simple ways to help avoid this:

- If you are just getting started, read the license before using that code in
  your project. As you build your team, make sure it is part of your team's
  workflow.
- For existing projects, scan for licenses (including any dependencies those
  projects use) and review them to make sure you aren't already using a
  protective license.
- If there are any Copyleft licenses, you need to further evaluate that you are
  not violating them. I’d suggest starting with [TLDR
  Legal](https://tldrlegal.com/) and refer further questions to your lawyer.

## License scanning process

We recently went through this process and wrote a script that scans our github
repository for license files and categorizes them based on fuzzy matching. This
substantially reduces the time it takes to review the licenses. [Here's the
script](https://github.com/gravitational/licensinator) (with a permissive
license :).

After the initial scan, we manually reviewed them to make sure there were not
any errors in the matching. For any licenses that were not permissive, we made
sure we are complying with the terms of the license. Thankfully, there were
only permissive and weak Copyleft licenses which generally means it is ok if
you are just linking to them and not modifying them to create derivative works.

The results of the analysis are here:

As you can see, these licenses add up quickly so it’s good to keep an eye on them.

## Third party services

There are a number of third party services that will help with this process,
including traditional vendors like
[WhiteSource](http://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/) and
[Blackduck](https://www.blackducksoftware.com/).

Another new and promising entrant to the market, and one I wish I found before
going through the steps above, is FOSSA. They actually run
the [TLDR Legal](https://tldrlegal.com/) site and they make it really easy to
get started. Their product also allows you to create policies and it will
analyze your repos dynamically, each time you commit. Finally, they have nice
integrations with issue trackers, like Jira, to check off any issues as you
resolve them. I went through the same process with their private beta and I was
really impressed by how much easier it made the process.

## Conclusion

This is not the most exciting side of software but it is something that can
hurt your business and damage your reputation if you are not careful. You can
alleviate a lot of anxiety at critical moments by instituting some minor
controls early in your development process to make sure you are not infringing
on others' rights.
