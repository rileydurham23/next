## Introduction

MongoDB is one of the most popular open-source databases. Unfortunately, this
also means ubiquity of misconfigured and unsecured MongoDB deployments out in
the wild. Just in recent years, we've seen several hacks involving thousands
of MongoDB databases left exposed online without any protection, making them
ripe for the hacker's picking.

It doesn't have to be this way, though. There are many steps you can take to
keep your MongoDB data safe — from protecting the network perimeter to using
strong transport security to taking advantage of MongoDB's advanced user
management and role-based access control (RBAC) system.

In this article, we will go over some of the most common ways to securing your
MongoDB cluster.

## Change default port

Let's start with something simple. Just like any other database, by default
MongoDB listens for client connections on a well-known port, `27017`. Port
scanning is a hacker's favorite tool and is trivial to do, so it's always a
good idea to change the default listen port to something else.

You can change the port using `net.port` configuration option:

```yaml
net:
  port: 38128
```

This simple measure alone would have likely prevented a fair amount of the
aforementioned data breaches.

## Restrict listen interface(-s)

Starting from version 3.6, MongoDB binds to localhost by default. It is a good
default which you will probably need to change unless all your clients connect
from the same node.

Use `net.bindIp` configuration option to specify IP address(-es) your clients
will be using to connect to the server, or DNS names which will make configuration
resilient to IP changes and is useful for replica sets and sharded clusters:

```yaml
net:
  bindIp: localhost,192.168.0.1,mongo-1.internal
```

Avoid using `0.0.0.0` as a bind IP and `net.bindIpAll` option — these will make
the server listen on all available interfaces.

## Use Unix domain sockets

If your clients _do_ connect from the same node, consider disabling TCP socket
listening entirely, and have them connect over the Unix domain sockets, on
Unix-based systems.

In order to do that, set the socket path explicitly as a bind IP and adjust
the socket file permissions to allow your clients to connect:

```yaml
net:
  bindIp: /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock
  unixDomainSocket:
    filePermissions: 0660
```

You can use `netstat` command to ensure that MongoDB server is not listening
on any interfaces with this configuration:

```bash
sudo netstat -lpten | grep mongo
```

## Restrict network access with a firewall

More often than not, however, your clients will need to connect to MongoDB
servers over the network. After changing the default port and restricting
listen addresses, the next layer of defense you can (and should) put up is
protecting the network access.

On Linux, you can use `iptables` utility to lock down all ports on the machine
where your MongoDB server runs, except those required by your clients, and only
allow connections from trusted IPs:

```
# Keep established connections.
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

# Open SSH port to the local subnet.
# It is a common best practice to move SSH off of its well-known port 22 too.
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW --dport 42422 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT

# Open MongoDB port to the local subnet.
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW --dport 38128 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT

# Allow all outbound, drop everything else inbound.
iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
iptables -A FORWARD -j DROP
```

Use `DROP` instead of `REJECT` target for all other incoming traffic which will
hinder the attacker's progress should they decide to port-scan your server to
see what software runs on it.

Also, whenever dealing with iptables, consider using [iptables-apply](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/iptables-apply.8.html)
tool instead of reloading the chains directly to avoid locking yourself out in
case of a mistake in the rules.

## Use SSH port forwarding

The firewall configuration can be locked down further to only allow a single
inbound SSH port if you make use of the SSH protocol's ability to forward ports.

To do that, set up local port forwarding prior to connecting to your MongoDB
server:

```bash
ssh -N -L 27017:127.0.0.1:38128 -p 42422 <mongodb-server-user>@<mongodb-server-host>
```

This command will connect to your MongoDB server via SSH over port `42422` and
start forwarding port `27017` on your local computer to `38128` on the server
so your local clients (e.g. `mongo` shell) can just connect to `localhost:27017`.

This configuration can be made more persistent by using SSH configuration file
(`~/.ssh/config`):

```
Host mongodb
    Hostname <mongodb-server-host>
    User <mongodb-server-user>
    LocalForward 27017 127.0.0.1:38128
```

With this config, the local port forward will be set up whenever you do `ssh mongodb`.

## Use SSH reverse tunneling

Reverse tunneling (aka remote port forward) is another SSH feature that can come
in handy when restricting network access to your database server.

The downside of it is that it requires the server to be able to dial the client
machine to establish the tunnel. The upside, however, is that it allows you to
disable _all_ inbound connectivity to the server from untrusted networks.

The following command run from the MongoDB server will create a reverse tunnel
to the client host and start forwarding port `27017` on the client host to the
local `38128` port:

```bash
ssh -f -N -T -R 27017:127.0.0.1:38128 <client-user>@<client-host>
```

For this to work, client host should be accessible from the server, have the
SSH daemon running and allow `<client-user>` to log in.

## Connect from a bastion host

Using a bastion, or a jump server, is a common practice to gating access to your
internal infrastructure. The bastion acts as a client host and you never connect
to your MongoDB (or any other) server directly from your computer.

Combined with SSH local port forwarding, the bastion host can be used transparently
so you never have to actually SSH into it:

```
Host mongodb
    Hostname <bastion-host>
    User <bastion-user>
    LocalForward 27017 <mongodb-server-host>:38128
```

Another advantage of using a bastion host is it lets you set up a more
strict firewall policy on your MongoDB servers by only allowing client
connections from the bastion.

## Use X.509 server authentication

Now that we've gone over the main ways to protect your MongoDB server network
perimeter, let's take a closer look at making your client-to-server (and server-
to-server in case of replica sets) communications more secure.

Once upon a time MongoDB distributions didn't include TLS support by default so
you'd have to compile the server yourself with `openssl` to get it. Fortunately,
those days are long gone, and any recent MongoDB version supports TLS out of
the box.

Configuring server TLS authentication allows connecting clients to verify the
identity of the server. First, you'd need to obtain a TLS certificate that
your server will present to the clients and a CA certificate that clients will
use to verify that the presented certificate is signed by a trusted authority.

You can use [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to get free TLS certificates
from Let's Encrypt, or just generate a self-signed CA and sign a certificate
locally using `openssl` commands.

Make a self-signed server CA:

```bash
openssl req -sha256 -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes \
    -out server-ca.crt \
    -keyout server-ca.key
```

Generate server CSR. Put the hostname you will be using to connect to the
database in the Common Name (CN) field. Also, make sure to include at least one
of Organization (O) or Organizational Unit (OU) attributes as well. The value
doesn't matter as long as it's the same for all cluster members — it will be used
for cluster member authentication that we'll take a look at later:

```bash
openssl req -sha256 -new -nodes \
    -subj "/CN=mongo-1.internal/O=ACME" \
    -out mongo-1.csr \
    -keyout mongo-1.key
```

Sign a server certificate:

```bash
openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 \
    -in mongo-1.csr \
    -CA server-ca.crt \
    -CAkey server-ca.key \
    -CAcreateserial \
    -out mongo-1.crt
```

For multi-node clusters, sign a certificate for each node. MongoDB requires
certificate and key be in the same file, so put them together in a single PEM
file:

```bash
cat mongo-1.crt mongo-1.key > mongo-1.pem
```

Now you can update the server configuration to enable TLS. It is also a good
idea to disable legacy TLS versions and force the clients to use TLS 1.3:

```yaml
net:
  tls:
    mode: requireTLS
    certificateKeyFile: /path/to/mongo-1.pem
    disabledProtocols: TLS1_0,TLS1_1,TLS1_2
```

All clients will now have to connect using TLS:

```bash
mongo --tls --tlsCAFile /path/to/server-ca.crt ...
```

## Use X.509 client authentication

Client certificate authentication allows the server to verify identity of the
connecting clients by verifying that the X.509 certificate presented by the
client is signed by a trusted certificate authority.

Similarly to server TLS, first create the CA for client certificates and sign
a certificate with it for a user who we'll call Alice.

Make a self-signed client CA:

```bash
openssl req -sha256 -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes \
    -out client-ca.crt \
    -keyout client-ca.key
```

Generate client CSR. The Subject field will identify your MongoDB user:

```bash
openssl req -sha256 -new -nodes \
    -subj "/CN=alice" \
    -out alice.csr \
    -keyout alice.key
```

Sign a client certificate:

```bash
openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 \
    -in alice.csr \
    -CA client-ca.crt \
    -CAkey client-ca.key \
    -CAcreateserial \
    -out alice.crt
```

Again, concatenate Alice's certificate and key pair in a PEM file:

```bash
cat alice.crt alice.key > alice.pem
```

Note that when using X.509 authentication, MongoDB uses the entire client
certificate's Subject field as a username — so the certificate you generated
above will identify as a `CN=alice` MongoDB user (not just `alice`).

X.509 users must also be created in the `$external` MongoDB authentication
database, so connect to your server and create it using `createUser` command:

```js
db.getSiblingDB("$external").runCommand({
  createUser: "CN=alice",
});
```

Finally, enable X.509 authentication by providing the server with the client
certificate authority file it will use to verify certificates presented by
clients:

```yaml
net:
  tls:
    mode: requireTLS
    certificateKeyFile: /path/to/mongo-1.pem
    disabledProtocols: TLS1_0,TLS1_1,TLS1_2
    CAFile: /path/to/client-ca.crt
```

Note that after enabling this option, each client will be required to present a
valid client certificate in order to connect:

```bash
mongo --tls --tlsCAFile /path/to/server-ca.crt --tlsCertificateKeyFile /path/to/alice.pem ...
```

You can use `net.tls.allowConnectionsWithoutCertificates` configuration option
to let clients using other forms of authentication (e.g. password) to connect
as well.

## Use X.509 member authentication

Members in replica sets or sharded clusters can also authenticate each other
using client certificates, which is a better alternative to using the
[keyfiles](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-internal-authentication/#std-label-internal-auth-keyfile).

MongoDB places a few restrictions on the certificates that can be used for
member authentication:

- Each member certificate must be signed by the same Certificate Authority.
- Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Names (SAN) must match the server
  hostname.
- At least one of Organization (O), Organizational Unit (OU) or Domain
  Component (DC) attributes must not be empty and be the same for all members.
- Extended Key Usage must either include `clientAuth` or not be present.
- Certificate should obviously not be expired.

The certificates you generated for server authentication above satisfy these
requirements so all you need to do is enable X.509 member authentication in
the configuration:

```yaml
security:
  clusterAuthMode: x509
```

To confirm it is working, look for the member authentication messages in MongoDB
logs which would look similar to:

```
{"t":{"$date":"2021-07-15T05:57:35.661+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"ACCESS",   "id":20427,   "ctx":"conn11","msg":"Authenticate","attr":{"db":"$external","command":"{ authenticate: 1, mechanism: \"MONGODB-X509\", user: \"CN=mongo-2,O=ACME\", $db: \"$external\" }"}}
{"t":{"$date":"2021-07-15T05:57:35.662+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"ACCESS",   "id":20429,   "ctx":"conn11","msg":"Successfully authenticated","attr":{"user":"CN=mongo-2,O=ACME","db":"$external","client":"172.18.0.3:57382"}}
```

## Restrict member source IPs

In addition to enabling X.509 member authentication, you can also restrict
connections to members reaching out from authorized networks only.

The `security.clusterIpSourceWhitelist` setting lets you specify IP addresses
and CIDR ranges to accept replica set or sharded cluster member connections
from:

```yaml
security:
  clusterIpSourceWhitelist:
    - 127.0.0.1
    - ::1
    - 192.168.0.0/24
```

If the connecting member (`mongod` or `mongos`) IP is not in the list or CIDR
range, it won't be authenticated.

## Use role-based access control

Client authentication you configured earlier makes sure your MongoDB server can
verify the connecting client's identity. Now is the time to figure out what the
client can actually do once they're connected.

### Authorization

MongoDB enables client authorization automatically when member authentication
(via keyfile or X.509) is enabled. If you decide not to use internal member
authentication for some reason, enable authorization explicitly:

```yaml
security:
  authorization: enabled
```

### Built-in roles

To start using RBAC, you'd need to assign roles to your MongoDB users. A role
grants permissions to perform certain _actions_ on certain _resources_.

A resource can be a collection, a database, or a cluster (for actions that
require cluster-wide permissions), while actions define operations a user
can perform on a given resource.

MongoDB provides a set of built-in roles that serve as a good starting point.
You can see the full list of built-in roles [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/built-in-roles/)
but the most common are:

- `read`: allows read-only access to the non-system collections in a database
- `readWrite`: extends the read-only role with ability to modify data in the
  non-system collections as well
- `userAdmin`: contains user and role management permissions
- `dbAdmin`: allows administrative database actions such as creating or deleting
  collections and indexes, but does not include read access

These roles are available in each MongoDB database and scoped to that particular
database.

The "admin" database, additionally, provides the roles that grant the same
permissions cluster-wide: `readAnyDatabase`, `readWriteAnyDatabase`,
`userAdminAnyDatabase` and `dbAdminAnyDatabase`.

Finally, the `root` built-in role provides full access to all resources and
should be used very sparingly (if ever).

You can update the Alice user created above to grant her full access to a
particular database and let her read everything else:

```js
db.getSiblingDB("$external").runCommand({
  // Use "updateUser" command to update an existing user.
  createUser: "CN=alice",
  roles: [
    { role: "readWrite", db: "example" },
    { role: "userAdmin", db: "example" },
    { role: "readAnyDatabase", db: "admin" },
  ],
});
```

### User roles

Sometimes you might want a little bit more flexibility; for example, to construct
finer-grained roles or extend one of the built-in ones with a couple of additional
permissions. For situations like this, MongoDB supports user-defined roles.

To create your own role, decide which actions it will permit on which resources.
As discussed above, a resource is a database, a collection, or the cluster:

```js
// Specifies "metrics" collection in the "example" database.
{ db: "example", collection: "metrics" }

// Specifies all non-system collections in the "example" database.
{ db: "example", collection: "" }

// Specifies "metrics" collections across all databases.
{ db: "", collection: "metrics" }

// Specifies all non-system collections across all databases.
{ db: "", collection: "" }

// Specifies cluster-wide permissions.
{ cluster: true }
```

MongoDB has many actions that let users query the documents (`find`), modify
data (`insert`, `update`, `remove`) or users and roles (`createUser`,
`createRole`, etc.), perform server administration and replica set management,
and virtually anything else a MongoDB user or an administrator might need. See
the full list [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/privilege-actions/).

A privilege document combines the resource definition with a list of actions:

```js
// Allow read-only access to a particular database.
{ resource: { db: "example", collection: "" }, actions: [ "find" ] }

// Allow read-write access to a particular collection.
{ resource: { db: "example", collection: "metrics" }, actions: [ "find", "update", "insert", "remove" ] }

// Allow the user to shutdown the server.
{ resource: { cluster: true }, actions: [ "shutdown" ] }
```

Now let's create a role for a hypothetical "metrics writer" user that is only
allowed to write to a particular collection. Keep in mind your custom role can
also extend an existing role to inherit its permissions:

```js
db.createRole({
  role: "metricsWriter",
  privileges: [
    { resource: { db: "", collection: "metrics" }, actions: ["insert"] },
  ],
  roles: [{ role: "readWrite", db: "metrics" }],
});
```

Custom roles can also place authentication restrictions on the connecting
clients by verifying that the client's IP address is allowed:

```js
db.createRole(
  {
    role: "metricsWriter",
    privileges: [ ... ],
    roles: [ ... ],
    authenticationRestrictions: [
      {
        clientSource: [ "127.0.0.1", "192.168.0.0/24" ]
      }
    ]
  }
)
```

This is a useful security feature in addition to your firewall configuration
allowing for more flexible network segregation of the clients.

## Enable access and query logging

Keeping a detailed audit trail is an integral part of any system's security
hardening. Unfortunately, MongoDB doesn't provide built-in audit logging
capabilities in its open-source version. The next best thing you can do is
enable verbose logging.

MongoDB's logging system is component-based. For security purposes, you'd
be most interested in the following components:

- `network` to capture connection attempts
- `accessControl` to capture authentication information
- `command`, `query` and `write` to capture command activity

Enable those in the configuration:

```yaml
systemLog:
  component:
    accessControl:
      verbosity: 1
    network:
      verbosity: 1
    command:
      verbosity: 1
    query:
      verbosity: 1
    write:
      verbosity: 1
```

MongoDB logs are structured JSON documents so you might also consider shipping
them to an external system, such as Elasticsearch, for indexing and analysis
using tools like Logstash.

## Use Teleport to secure access

Teleport Database Access is an open-source product that implements many of the
best practices discussed in this article and can be used to secure access to
your MongoDB clusters.

In particular, the Database Access has been designed with the following
security principles in mind:

- Your MongoDB databases are never exposed publicly and connect back to the
  Teleport control plane over persistent reverse tunnels.
- Users authenticate with your Identity Provider and connect to the database
  using short-lived client certificates.
- Configurable role-based access control policies allow you to map your IdP
  users onto allowed MongoDB users.
- All database authentication and command activity is being captured in the
  audit log shippable to third-party SIEM systems.

Get started with Database Access by exploring [documentation](https://goteleport.com/docs/database-access/introduction)
and MongoDB [guide](https://goteleport.com/docs/ver/7.0/database-access/guides/mongodb-self-hosted/). We'll be hosting a Webinar on August 19th covering more tips on
Securing MongoDB and previewing using Teleport to secure access.
