In this blog post we are going to talk about the quick experiment we did with Go and [Elastic
beats](https://www.elastic.co/beats). We will integrate Go logger to
emit logs in structured format to Elastic Search for your viewing pleasure.

## What is beats?

Beats is a [new awesome Go library](https://github.com/elastic/beats) to build
and ship documents to ElasticSearch. We've decided to give it a try and
integrate Go structured logger [logrus](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus) to
ship logs to ELK using new API.

## Structured logs

First, lets write start emitting structured logs.

We will use combination of [logrus](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus) to emit
logs and [trace](https://github.com/gravitational/trace) that provides a hook
to capture debugging info such as file, line and function and emit UDP events
(will get to the UDP part later).

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
	"os/signal"
	"time"
	log "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
	"github.com/gravitational/trace"
)

func main() {
	// Log as JSON instead of the default ASCII formatter.
	log.SetFormatter(&trace.TextFormatter{})

	h, err := trace.NewUDPHook()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("hook: %v", err)
	}
	log.AddHook(h)

	log.Infof("something new")
	log.WithFields(log.Fields{trace.Component: "play"}).Infof("this time")
}
```

Or if you are lazy, just grab it from
[github](https://github.com/gravitational/udpbeat/blob/master/examplebeater/main.go):

```bash
$ go install github.com/gravitational/udpbeat/examplebeater
$ examplebeater
```

This little program will periodically emit logs with file, line, function and
other parts to UDP address.

## Udpbeat

[Udpbeat](https://github.com/gravitational/udpbeat) is a
[Beats](https://github.com/elastic/beats) based agent that collects UDP
messages and ships them to ELK

Here's how it all works together:

<BlogImage src="./assets/beats.png" />

Agent can run on any machine and your processes will be shipping logs to this
tiny agent without bringing beat's deps or depending on Elasticsearch API

```bash
$ go install github.com/gravitational/udpbeat
$ udpbeat -c ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/gravitational/udpbeat/trace.yml
```

Note, that you can (and probably should) modify the configs to setup logging/output.

## ELK part

Ok, the last part is starting Elasticsearch and Kibana and setting document
schema. That's easy with Docker.

Start ElasticSearch and Kibana:

```bash
$ docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 --name elk -d elasticsearch
$ docker run -p 5601:5601 --link elk:elasticsearch -d kibana
```

Set `trace` document schema to tell ELK how to index incoming documents emitted by `udpbeat`

```bash
$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_template/trace' \
       -d@${GOPATH}/src/github.com/gravitational/udpbeat/template.json
```

This [template.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitational/udpbeat/master/template.json)
explaing ElasticSearch how to interpret the incoming document's fields

- Open Kibana and configure mappings:

- Discover the logs emitted by our little test logging library:

## Summary

[Beats](https://github.com/elastic/beats) is a major step forward to writing
customized data shippers, paired with Go's runtime knowledge of lines, files we
get very nice framework for production logging.

**Notice** [Udpbeat](https://github.com/gravitational/udpbeat) is quite nice
and simple, but we haven't tested it in production yet,however we are about to
that very soon!
