Teleport 4.2 introduced a new feature called Enhanced Session Recording that takes an unstructured SSH session and outputs a stream of
structured events. It’s the next step in Teleport's evolution that uses new technology (eBPF or now simply known as BPF) to close some gaps
in Teleport's audit abilities. Below you can see an illustration of this feature and if you keep reading, we’ll get into some of the
technical details.

_Figure 1: Demonstration of how Enhanced Session Recording transforms an unstructured SSH session into a stream of structured events._

## Background

Teleport has included session recordings since the initial version. Session recordings capture everything that the user sees printed to the
terminal and can later be played back like a video for auditing purposes. This has an inherent advantage: these recordings are easy to
understand and provide valuable context around what a user was doing during the session.

However, it also has some disadvantages, mainly that there are a variety of ways a user can bypass the session recording.

- _Obfuscation_. Even though the command \
  **`echo 'Y3VybCBodHRwOi8vd3d3LmV4YW1wbGUuY29tCg==' | base64 --decode | sh`** does not contain <strong>`curl http://www.example.com`</strong>, that is what is run when decoded. The curl command never shows up in the SSH session recording.
- <em>Shell scripts</em>. If a user uploads and executes a script, the commands
  within the script that are run are not captured, simply the output of the
  script. This makes understanding the actions of even legitimate tools like
  Ansible difficult.
- <em>Terminal controls</em>. Terminals support a wide variety of controls
  including the ability for users to disable terminal echo. This is commonly
  used by applications like <strong>`sudo`</strong> when they prompt a user for
  credentials. Disabling terminal echo can also be used to run commands without
  them being captured in the SSH recording.

Furthermore, due to the unstructured nature of a TTY stream, session recordings can be somewhat difficult to ingest and monitor.

## Implementation

To close this gap in auditing, Teleport needed a way to transform an unstructured SSH session into a structured stream of events that occur
during that session. What should those structured events contain? As a starting point, we wanted to show what program was executing (program
on disk) and what was it doing (its behavior).

We investigated a variety of approaches. The things we looked into varied from ad-hoc approaches like regex pattern matching to more complex
attempts like parsing the raw SSH session ourselves. We also investigated a variety of APIs and systems that Linux provides like Audit,
fanotify, and BPF.

We had a couple of critical criteria when selecting which technology to build on.

- _Reduce false positives, ideally to zero_. If your system has a high degree of false alerts, less attention is paid to an alert. This can
  cause critical issues to go unnoticed.
- _Reduce any performance impact caused by monitoring, ideally to zero_. The chances of a company adopting a monitoring system that reduces the performance of a system any substantial amount is low. Furthermore, this offloads the burden of adding additional resources to the user.

These ad-hoc approaches all suffered from the false positive problem. There is no way that we could parse and interpret the stream of bytes
that compose a SSH session with enough accuracy to not cause alert fatigue.

We investigated other approaches. We ruled out Linux Audit due to performance reasons. This is something Dino Dai Zovi has mentioned on
[several](https://twitter.com/dinodaizovi/status/1171762209090953217)
[occasions](https://twitter.com/dinodaizovi/status/1214729783755628544).

When looking at file system access some alternatives exist. The two that stood out the most are **`inotify`** and <strong>`fanotify`</strong>. The lack of recursive directory monitoring in <strong>
`inotify` </strong> makes it a non-starter for Teleport. <strong>`fanotify`</strong> is more promising, but it has two problems.

- As Brendan Gregg mentions in _[BPF Performance Tools](http://www.brendangregg.com/bpf-performance-tools-book.html)_, during heavy load
  comparing **`fanotify`** to <strong>`opensnoop`</strong>, <strong>`fanotify`</strong> used 67% CPU while
  <strong>`opensnoop`</strong> used 1%.
- The kernel recently merged in a patch set to make <strong>`fanotify`</strong> more performant and make it suitable for whole
  filesystem monitoring which more closely aligns with its use in Teleport. Unfortunately, these changes were merged in Linux 5.1, which means
  there are no mainstream distributions where this would even work out of the box at the moment.

With these considerations in mind, we ended up building a solution around a few BPF programs that reduced the false positives and had
minimal impact on performance. For a more in depth discussion about the alternatives, take a look at the Alternatives section below.

### What is BPF?

Brendan Gregg, a prolific author of BPF programs, has frequently said it’s “[a new type of
software](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2019-12-02/bpf-a-new-type-of-software.html).” BPF allows userspace programs to hook and emit
events from certain places within the kernel in a safe and performant manner.

What does safe and performant mean? In this context, “safe” means BPF programs can not get stuck in infinite loops bringing down the system.
BPF programs are unlikely to crash the entire operating system like a kernel module has the potential to. BPF programs are also performant,
dropping events if they can not be consumed fast enough instead of dragging down the entire systems performance with it.

### How does Teleport use BPF?

Teleport uses three BPF programs at the moment: [execsnoop](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2014-07-28/execsnoop-for-linux.html) to capture
program execution, [opensnoop](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2014-07-25/opensnoop-for-linux.html) to capture files opened by a program,
and [tcpconnect](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2015-10-31/tcpconnect-tcpaccept-bcc.html) to capture TCP connections established by a
program.

To get a better understanding of the power of these BPF programs, take a look at the output of execsnoop when running **`man ls`**.

```
# ./execsnoop

```

You can already start seeing the power of BPF programs. What seemed like simply running the **`man`** binary turned out to be the
execution of a variety of other programs under the hood.

Teleport [embeds these programs within](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/lib/bpf) its binary and when Enhanced Session
Recording is enabled, it builds and runs them.

On their own, these programs are excellent tools for debugging and tracing because they tell you what’s executing on the whole system,
rather being limited to one user. In fact, that’s how we initially ran into these tools: we used them to debug some issues with Teleport
that were causing it to run out of file descriptors in certain scenarios. However, our goals with Teleport were a bit different. We wanted
to correlate program execution with an SSH session and identity.

To correlate program execution with a particular SSH session, we use cgroups (cgroupv2 in particular). When Teleport starts a SSH session,
it first re-launches itself and places itself within a cgroup. This allows not only that process, but all future processes that Teleport
launches to be tracked with a unique ID. The BPF programs that Teleport runs have been updated to also [emit the cgroup ID of the program
executing](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/bf6fa2c893c5237b48569a13fa3c673041430b6c) them. This allows us to correlate events with
a particular SSH session and identity.

### Limitations

We’re not done with Enhanced Session Recording. There are clearly some gaps that still exist and we’ll be addressing them in the future.

Until that post is up, it’s worth pointing out that with session recording, Teleport is able to capture the stream of bytes that compose a
session due to its privileged position (the stream of bytes must flow through Teleport). Critically, the integrity of a session recording
does not rely on any information self reported by a host. The enhanced auditing, however, relies on the host accurately reporting
information to Teleport. If the integrity of the host is compromised, the integrity of the enhanced auditing is inherently compromised.
Furthermore, Teleport only monitors a subset of system calls that we felt were most critical, not all of them.

That means, at the moment, Enhanced Session Recording works best for non-root users. Users who have access to root can disable Enhanced
Session Recording in a variety of manners.

## Getting Started

With the background out of the way, you can use [this script on Github
Gist](https://gist.github.com/russjones/01fe0e5f0bfbabf73fb50b93f4d119ed) to take Enhanced Session Recording for a spin yourself to see its
power.

First spin up an Ubuntu 19.04 or RHEL/CentOS 8 VM and run the script linked to above. This script simply installs kernel headers and
bcc-tools, the prerequisites for running Enhanced Session Recording. It also installs jq, but that’s more to help in visualizing the
structured event stream.

Once you've typed in `curl https://goteleport.com` to the terminal like the instructions say, you should see something like the following
printed on the screen.

```
{
  "argv": [
    "https://goteleport.com/"
  ],
  "cgroup_id": 4294967355,
  "code": "T4000I",
  "ei": 15,
  "event": "session.command",
  "login": "root",
  "namespace": "default",
  "path": "/bin/curl",
  "pid": 2315,
  "ppid": 2294,
  "program": "curl",
  "return_code": 0,
  "server_id": "e56dc762-0171-4d6e-aa56-24f2ae268c7f",
  "sid": "72aabcd8-38c8-11ea-af55-42010a800031",
  "time": "2020-01-17T01:27:05.07Z",
  "uid": "4b493296-7df2-4ec7-9282-a19c0d98e261",
  "user": "test-user"
}
{
  "cgroup_id": 4294967355,
  "code": "T4002I",
  "dst_addr": "104.24.97.116",
  "dst_port": 80,
  "ei": 0,
  "event": "session.network",
  "login": "root",
  "namespace": "default",
  "pid": 2315,
  "program": "curl",
  "server_id": "e56dc762-0171-4d6e-aa56-24f2ae268c7f",
  "sid": "72aabcd8-38c8-11ea-af55-42010a800031",
  "src_addr": "10.128.0.49",
  "time": "2020-01-17T01:27:05.145Z",
  "uid": "42831223-1da2-4b26-a783-08060fd8d7b1",
  "user": "test-user",
  "version": 4
}
```

From this you can see that the **`curl`** program was executed by the user in two ways. The first is the execution of the program
itself. The second is the behavior of the program, <strong>`curl`</strong> made a network request and you can see that as well.

You can try other things, like scripts or other forms of obfuscation, and you should see the results of execution in the logs.

### Requirements

The minimum requirements for Teleport Enhanced Session Recording is Linux Kernel 4.18 with [BPF support
enabled](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md#kernel-configuration). There are several distributions where you get this out
of the box, including Ubuntu 19.04, Debian 10, and RHEL/CentOS 8.

You’ll also need to install kernel headers and bcc-tools. For the operating systems listed above, you can install these from packages and
it’s simply a matter of running **`yum install -y kernel-headers bcc-tools` or <strong>`apt install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r) bpfcc-tools`</strong>.** If bcc-tools have not been packaged, you’ll have to build them from source.

To enable Enhanced Session Recording in Teleport, simply toggle it on in file configuration like so:

```
    ssh_service:
       enhanced_recording:
          enabled: yes
```

## Conclusion

While no monitoring system is entirely infallible, using a strategy of [defense in
depth](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)>) with multiple safeguards can help you identify issues and take
appropriate action. Teleport’s Enhanced Session Recording can add vital extra visibility into commands being run on your systems.
