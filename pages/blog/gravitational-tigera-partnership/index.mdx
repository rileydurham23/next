Today, we are excited to announce that Teleport is working with
[Tigera](https://www.tigera.io/), the company behind Project Calico, to ensure
that its Private Kubernetes deployments will support
[Calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/) for secure, policy driven networking.

Teleport enables SaaS companies and independent software vendors to deploy
and manage their applications on their customers’ infrastructure (on-premises).
Our solution is based on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and it is crucial
that we deliver flexible, secure and reliable communication between the
services within each private deployment.

Sasha Klizhentas, Teleport's CTO, explains the reasoning behind using
Calico, "Calico has clearly become the de facto solution for Kubernetes
networking, with a well-engineered system that uses proven and well known
technologies like kernel layer 3 routing and filtering for fine-grained policy.
It scales well and sysadmins love it."

Tigera's work and expertise with Calico has been crucial in our ability to
offer it as a networking option and reduced our time to market. With their
help, now all Teleport customers will be able to select Calico in their
[Application Manifest](https://goteleport.com/gravity/docs/pack/#application-manifest) to best
suit their deployment environments. Networking options include flat layer 3
networking without overlays, direct peering to private cloud infrastructure, as
well as IP-in-IP or VXLAN for routing across public cloud regions and hybrid
cloud scenarios. Also, with Calico, Kubernetes Network Policy capabilities are
now available to Gravity users for enhanced application security.

It’s been great working with the Teleport team. Their Gravity platform is a use case that really shows off the benefits of using Calico. With Calico, they can give their customers a cloud native networking environment on any infrastructure, including private, bare metal servers.
