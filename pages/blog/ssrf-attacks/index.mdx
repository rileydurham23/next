Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is an attack that can be used to make your application issue arbitrary HTTP requests. SSRF is used by
attackers to proxy requests from services exposed on the internet to un-exposed internal endpoints. SSRF is a hacker reverse proxy. These
arbitrary requests often target internal network endpoints to perform anything from reconnaissance to complete account takeover. SSRF, along
with [XSS](https://goteleport.com/blog/xss-attacks) and [CSRF](https://goteleport.com/blog/csrf-attacks), are some of the most serious web
security vulnerabilities due to pervasiveness and impact.

## What is SSRF?

Upon first glance, adding the ability to issue a HTTP request from your application does not appear to be the type of feature that would
require a security review. However, any time you allow a user to control the target of an HTTP request, an attacker can use your
application's privileged position within an internal network to stage an exploit.

[Webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) are a great example of this. By design, developers want users to control the target
address of a webhook. However, this means attackers can also control the target address. This allows attackers to either directly target
internal IP addresses or internal addresses through attacker-controlled DNS.

What this means is that regardless of how strictly you firewall off sensitive internal services or applications, if you allow your publicly
exposed applications access to those internal applications and attackers to control the HTTP request target, attacks can potentially find a
path to those sensitive applications.

If you didn't fully grasp everything above, don’t worry, it’ll make more sense as we cover some examples below.

## Exploiting SSRF

### SSRF

Let’s start with a simple sample application that acts as a sort of online hexdump. The application accepts a URL, issues the request, and
outputs a hexdump of the response body. You can see a sample output as well as the source of this application in Figures (1) and (2).

```

_Figure 1: Example output of an HTTP hexdump application._

However, what happens if this hexdump application has network access to a sensitive internal application? For example, you may be following
best practices and using an internal secrets service to securely store credentials your application needs instead of checking them into
source.

That’s exactly what the program in Figure (2) simulates. To run this application, save the code in Figure (2) in a file called `ssrf1.go`
and then type `go run ssrf1.go` to run the application.

First navigate to the application at `http://localhost:8080?url=http://www.google.com` to view the hexdump of `www.google.com`. To trigger
the SSRF, navigate to `http://localhost:8080?url=http://localhost:8081` to fetch an internal secret.

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
)

// secretServer mimics an internal service that returns sensitive
// credentials.
type secretServer struct {
}

// ListenAndServe will start an HTTP server and bind to 127.0.0.1:8081.
func (s *secretServer) ListenAndServe() error {
	server := &http.Server{
		Addr:    "127.0.0.1:8081",
		Handler: http.HandlerFunc(s.handler),
	}
	return server.ListenAndServe()
}

// handler returns sensitive credentials that only internal applications
// should have access to.
func (s *secretServer) handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "SECRET_CREDENTIALS")
}

// applicationServer is the public facing service that returns a hex
// dump of the requested URL.
type applicationServer struct {
}

// ListenAndServe will start an HTTP server and bind to :8080.
func (s *applicationServer) ListenAndServe() error {
	server := &http.Server{
		Addr:    ":8080",
		Handler: http.HandlerFunc(s.handler),
	}
	return server.ListenAndServe()
}

// handler returns a hexdump of the request URL passed in as a query parameter.
func (s *applicationServer) handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// Extract the URL from the query parameters.
	urls, ok := r.URL.Query()["url"]
	if !ok {
		http.Error(w, "url missing", 500)
		return
	}
	if len(urls) != 1 {
		http.Error(w, "url missing", 500)
		return
	}

	// Fetch the requested URL.
	resp, err := http.Get(urls[0])
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, err.Error(), 500)
		return
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	// Read in the response body.
	bytes, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, err.Error(), 500)
		return
	}

	// Write out the hexdump of the bytes as plaintext.
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/plain; charset=utf-8")
	fmt.Fprint(w, hex.Dump(bytes))
}

func main() {
	// Start the secret service.
	var ss *secretServer
	go ss.ListenAndServe()

	// Start the application service.
	var as *applicationServer
	as.ListenAndServe()
}
```

_Figure 2: An example of a classic SSRF bug._

Let’s dig into what happened. The program in Figure (2) runs the `hexdump` application and also simulates running of a secret service. While
the `hexdump` application binds to all interfaces, the secret service only binds to `loopback`, a reasonable decision for something that
should not be exposed to the internet.

The problem is that `hexdump` is running locally and can issue requests to `loopback` (or any other internal endpoint). Simply pointing
`hexdump` at `http://localhost:8081` is all that is needed to expose internal credentials regardless of the fact that it doesn’t actually
listen on any publicly exposed interfaces.

#### SSRF on AWS

The [AWS Instance Metadata Service (IMDSv1)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) is an excellent
illustration of how powerful SSRF can be. In fact, Colin Percival has called it [EC2’s most dangerous
feature](https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2016-10-09-EC2s-most-dangerous-feature.html).

The Instance Metadata Service is quite interesting in that it can be utilized to both increase and decrease the security of your application
at the same time.

It can be used to increase the security of your application by helping you securely manage secret credential lifecycle (a difficult task).
You can attach an [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) to the instance your application is running on
and then fetch your credentials from the instance metadata endpoint. Once the instance is terminated, these credentials are destroyed and a
new set of credentials are issued. In theory this helps in secret credential lifecycle; it lessens the number of credentials that can be
exposed in a breach and reduces the lifespan of credentials to the lifetime of the instance.

However, if your application is vulnerable to SSRF, that same benefit can be turned around on you by allowing an attacker to also retrieve
your instance's credentials. Now you may say that this was true of IMDSv1 but [no longer true of
IMDSv2](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/defense-in-depth-open-firewalls-reverse-proxies-ssrf-vulnerabilities-ec2-instance-metadata-service/).
While this is true, by default IMDSv1 is always enabled, so it’s still a common and pervasive issue.

If you are familiar with AWS and are using IAM roles already, you can use `curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/$roleName` to already see how deadly a SSRF in your application could be.

If you are not familiar with AWS, you can use the example script in Figure (3) to create an IAM role, VPC, and EC2 instance that can be used
to query the metadata endpoint. Note that you will be billed for usage, so make sure to shut down this instance once you're done.

### Blind SSRF

Blind SSRF is a subset of SSRF attacks. In the previous examples, the client has been able to see the response to a request. Blind SSRF is
when you can perform the request, but can’t see the response. At first glance, it appears to be a rather weak vulnerability. However, there
are a few interesting attacks that can still be performed.

One example is utilizing blind SSRF to change the state of an internal service. An example of this was a [blind SSRF bug in Jira that could
be used to make arbitrary HTTP POST requests within GitLab infrastructure](https://hackerone.com/reports/398799). Another example is using
blind SSRF to perform port scanning from inside the target network. An example of this was a [blind SSRF bug in Jira that could be used to
map out New Relic infrastructure](https://hackerone.com/reports/344032).

Below in Figure (5) you’ll see the source for an application that acts similar to what a webhook service would do. The user submits a URL,
the service attempts to fetch the URL, and returns the status code (and error message) back to the user.

To run this application, save the code from Figure (5) in a file called `ssrf2.go` and then type `go run ssrf3.go` to run the application
and navigate to the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"time"

   submitButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
      var respStatus = document.getElementById("responseStatus");
      var respError = document.getElementById("responseError");
      var respTime = document.getElementById("responseTime");

      var textInput = document.getElementById("textInput");

   	  fetch("/submit", {

   	     body: JSON.stringify({
   	        "endpoint": textInput.value,
   	     })
   	  }).then((response) => response.json()
	  ).then((data) => {
         respStatus.innerText = "Status: "+data.status;
         respTime.innerText = "Time: "+data.time;

_Figure 5: An application that can be used to map out an internal network._

To understand how blind SSRF can be exploited, try a few endpoints on your host and see how they respond. A few ideas to explore your
network are:

- Try a port that has no service listening on it.
- Try port 22 to see how SSH responds.
- Try a port with a web server listening on it.
- Does timing of a response provide any useful information?

## SSRF Mitigation Techniques

In an ideal situation, your application does not need to make arbitrary requests, or at minimum, only needs to make requests to a
whitelisted set of endpoints. In that situation, you largely don’t have to worry about SSRF because the attacker cannot control the target
endpoint.

Unfortunately as we have seen in the previous examples, this is often not possible. In fact, you may be writing an application where you
want to give the user control of the endpoint, like webhooks.

Mitigations for SSRF can typically occur in two broad categories: you apply controls either at the network layer or application layer.

### Mitigating SSRF with Firewalls

A common mitigation for SSRF is to implement firewall policies about what the hosts running the application are able to connect to. This is
most commonly applied to existing network infrastructure where firewalls are placed at strategic locations within the network architecture,
or placed closer to the hosts using interface ACLs on networking equipment, or even host-based firewalls to restrict outbound connectivity.

Firewalls can be brittle, as any firewall applied to a host will not be able to differentiate between connections made by an application vs.
rules for normal operation of the node or other software on the same node. Firewalls also can only apply policy to traffic they see, so a
diagnostic endpoint bound to localhost or other nodes within the same network may be accessible to the application.

Applications creating outbound connections based on a client's request are also uncommon, that future updates to the firewall policy may not
account for an application that can create arbitrary requests.

Another good network layer defense is using something like [Smokescreen](https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen) which was developed at
Stripe. Smokescreen is a HTTP CONNECT proxy that you can funnel all your traffic through and use it to place ACLs on where traffic is
allowed.

<Quote>
  “Smokescreen restricts which URLs it connects to: it resolves each domain name
  that is requested and ensures that it is a publicly routable IP and not a
  Stripe-internal IP. This prevents a class of attacks where, for instance, our
  own webhooks infrastructure is used to scan Stripe's internal network.”
</Quote>

The only catch is that your application needs to actually support HTTP CONNECT proxies and be willing to route your traffic over it. The
good news is — this is often supported by default. For example, the [DefaultTransport](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#RoundTripper) in Go
already does this, and even adding HTTP CONNECT proxy support for other protocols — [like we did with
SSH](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/v6.0.0/lib/utils/proxy/proxy.go#L143-L193) — is straightforward.

#### Mutual Authentication

Another approach worth discussing is using mutual authentication on all internal services. Going back to the webhook example, even if the
attacker is able to control the target, chances are the connection will not be authenticated to talk to internal resources. However, note
the wording above, “chances are”. This approach is not a panacea. If the attacker can control an authenticated connection, SSRF is back on
the table.

### Mitigating SSRF with Application Controls

If you either don’t have control of the network configuration or can’t run additional software like an HTTP CONNECT proxy, you can mitigate
SSRF with application layer controls by checking that the target address is not within a blocked range.

How to implement this is critical — it’s not enough to try and resolve the address, validate it, then make the connection. This is
susceptible to [Time-of-check to time-of-use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use) vulnerabilities where the attacker
controls the DNS server and uses a short TTL to change the target address on the next query. If you’re using application layer controls,
make sure you use a lower layer hook. For example, [Andrew Ayer suggests using the Control
callback](https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/preventing_server_side_request_forgery_in_golang) with Go dialers to do just this.

This allows you to create safe dialers that can be drop-in replacements for regular dialers that can also apply access controls. Take a look
at the example in Figure (5) where you can use the drop-in `SafeClient` to not only apply CIDR checks, but also limit things like HTTP

Try updating the examples in Figure (2) and Figure (4) with `SafeClient` and try the exploits once again. They should now fail.

You can also try this program from the command line. Here are a few example commands to try.

```bash
$ go run ssrf3.go -addr="https://localhost"
2021/03/25 21:08:11 Get "https://localhost": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:443: unauthorized request
exit status 1

$ go run ssrf3.go -addr="https://localhost" -allow-loopback
2021/03/25 21:08:18 Get "https://localhost": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:443: connect: connection refused
exit status 1

$ go run ssrf3.go -addr="https://192.168.1.1" -allow-loopback -unsafe-cidrs=192.168.0.0/8
2021/03/25 21:09:02 Get "https://192.168.1.1": dial tcp 192.168.1.1:443: unauthorized request
```

## Conclusion

SSRF can be a difficult bug to mitigate, primarily because it can be situational. In some instances, you may want to allow your clients to
connect to internal IP addresses and not in others. However, careful selection of network-based and/or application-based controls can be
used to effectively mitigate SSRF.
