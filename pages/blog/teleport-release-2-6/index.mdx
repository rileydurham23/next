Today we are releasing a major new version of [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/), [version 2.6](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download), that brings several new features requested by Teleport administrators, both in cloud-native environments and those with more traditional data center fleets.

Before we dive into the details, let's introduce Teleport to the new readers of
this blog.

## What is Teleport?

Teleport is a [privileged SSH access manager](https://goteleport.com/) for elastic compute infrastructure.
Teleport brings productized SSH security best-practices to companies who have
traditionally relied on complex DIY solutions.

By adopting Teleport in your organization you will:

- Secure your infrastructure and meet compliance requirements.
- Reduce the operational overhead of enforcing security best-practices.
- Have complete visibility into access and behavior.

Teleport is open sourced and fully compatible with OpenSSH clients and servers
and can be used just as a bastion, issuing SSH certificates and providing
connectivity to legacy clusters located behind firewalls.

## What's new in 2.6?

As usual, the full list of changes can be found on [Github](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/22?closed=1)
but here are the major new features:

- Support for DynamoDB for storing the audit log.
- Ability to use AWS S3 for storing the recorded sessions.
- Support for certificate authority (CA) rotation.
- Integration with PAM (Linux Pluggable Authentication Module) subsystem.

In addition, the source code of this release has also gone through a security audit performed by [Cure53](https://cure53.de/).
This audit report will be published publicly by Cure53 in the near future.

### DynamoDB and S3

AWS users of Teleport can now store their cluster state in
AWS-provided storage back-ends. This release allows
AWS users to use DynamoDB and S3 to store audit information instead of using local disks (or EBS volumes).

This brings several advantages:

- S3 buckets have much more flexible [RBAC](https://goteleport.com/teleport/features/rbac-for-ssh/), which allows for policies
  like "write-only".
- DynamoDB offers much more robust search capabilities than JSON files on a
  local disk. Obviously, it scales better, as well, for large clusters with
  significant audit event traffic.
- Deploying highly available (HA) Teleport clusters is now much easier because
  all nodes are nearly stateless.

### Certificate Authority Rotation

Teleport is quite opinionated about SSH authentication and it only uses SSH
certificates, not keys. This important design decision makes the entire "SSH
key management" habit obsolete, because users' certificates are rotated daily
(or even hourly).

However, Teleport has historically used the same long-lived certificates for _host
authentication_. We have never been comfortable with this compromise, so in
this release we have finally added the ability to rotate _all_ certificates within
a cluster by rotating the certificate authority (CA) for both users and hosts.

To trigger CA rotation:

```bash
# execute this on a Teleport auth server to rotate both CAs, for users and hosts:
$ tctl auth rotate
```

This operation will start the rotation procedure and after a few hours all
previously issued certificates will be invalid. The rotate operation was
designed to be safe and to be used frequently. It uses the principle of a "grace
period" (24 hours by default) during which both sets of certificates, old
and new, are accepted. This gives the ability for users and hosts to
re-authenticate with the cluster and receive new certificates (hosts will do
this automatically).

You can read more about this in [the docs](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/admin/#certificate-rotation/).

### PAM Integration

Modern Linux systems rely on the [PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) subsystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM)
for authenticating users and customizing their sessions.

This release of Teleport allows administrators to define a PAM profile to be used
for SSH sessions initiated by the `teleport` daemon. This capability is not enabled
by default, but can be turned on by modifying the Teleport configuration file,
usually `/etc/teleport.yaml`:

```bash
teleport:
   ssh_service:
      pam:
         # "no" by default
         enabled: yes
         # use /etc/pam.d/sshd configuration (the default)
         service_name: "sshd"
```

Note that `/etc/pam.d/sshd` profile may not be installed on your system. In
this case you'll have to define your own.

### Upgrading

Follow the [recommended upgrade procedure](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport)
to upgrade to this version.

### AWS Marketplace Listing

We are happy to report that, due to popular demand, we are submitting this
release to be listed in the AWS marketplace. This will allow AWS users to quickly
instantiate properly deployed and configured Teleport clusters into their AWS
accounts using the AWS web interface.

Thanks to our community contributors and testers who helped us make 2.6 a reality!
