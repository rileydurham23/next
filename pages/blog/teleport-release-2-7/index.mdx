We are excited to announce the release of [Teleport 2.7](https://goteleport.com/).

Before we cover the new features and improvements, let's introduce Teleport to
the new readers of this blog.

## What is Teleport?

Teleport gives engineers an easy [SSH access](https://goteleport.com/) for elastic compute infrastructure.

Teleport delivers hardened DevOps &amp; SRE security best practices in a box to companies who have traditionally relied on static keys or complex DIY SSH bastion solutions.

By adopting Teleport in your organization you will:

- Secure its infrastructure and easily pass compliance requirements.
- Reduce the operational overhead of enforcing security best-practices.

Teleport allows low-level systems access to be controlled by _who the user
is within an organization_, not based on which private key they have.

Teleport is open source and compatible with OpenSSH clients and servers. With OpenSSH nodes, it can still be used as a man-in-the-middle bastion (aka jump box), issuing SSH certificates and providing session recording and audit logs for legacy clusters located behind firewalls.

## What's new in Teleport 2.7?

As usual, the full list of closed tickets can be found on [Github](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/25?closed=1).
You can also glance at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/9a7a801d5d9fd813a9e9846a359f30b619570d64/CHANGELOG.md) for a quick overview,
but the two areas we have focused on for 2.7 are:

- Performance improvements on large clusters (many thousands of servers).
- Enhanced configurability for compliance purposes (PCI-DSS, SOC2, GDPR, HIPPA, etc).
- Secure copy (SCP) file transfer support within Teleport's optional web-based terminal.

As with any release, version 2.7 brings various enhancements to the user
experience and makes it even easier to introduce modern priveledged access patterns to systems administrators and end-users alike.

## New Teleport Features

### Web-based SSH secure copy (SCP) using the Teleport Proxy UI

The Teleport Web UI has proven to be immensely popular with its users. People use
it as a great SSH certificate-based alternative to PuTTY or SecureCRT, others SSH on their phones / tablets via a browser.

A common request for the Web UI was to support uploading and
downloading files via `scp`. Teleport 2.7 now supports this feature:

### Compliance Enforcement of Idle SSH Connections

To satisfy various compliance requirements, like PCI-DSS, SOC2 and HIPAA, organizations must enforce
certain policies around handling of idle SSH connections. In the past, Teleport
relied on sensible defaults in its source code and administrators were required to
recompile from source if they wanted a different behavior.

With this release, Teleport adds a couple of configuration settings you can
tweak:

```bash
# snippet from /etc/teleport.yaml
#
auth_service:
    # Determines if SSH sessions to cluster nodes are forcefully terminated
    # after no activity from a client (idle client).
    # Examples: "30m", "1h" or "1h30m"
    client_idle_timeout: never

    # Determines if the clients will be forcefully disconnected when their
    # certificates expire in the middle of an active SSH session. (default is 'no')
    disconnect_expired_cert: no
```

## Large Cluster SSH Performance Enhancements

This version also optimizes performance for those leveraging Teleport on large
monolithic clusters. Some readers may question:

_"Why would performance of an SSH service depend on how many nodes I have?"_

The answer is that while the Teleport SSH daemon does not care about other nodes
in a cluster, certain Teleport features are implemented by _Auth Servers_,
not nodes. One example is searching for nodes by their labels. To support tens of thousands of nodes these features needed a performance boost which is delivered in version 2.7!

### Upgrading Teleport

This release is meant to be a simple drop-in replacement for 2.6, but as usual, we
recommend familiarizing yourself with the [recommended upgrade procedure](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/admin/#upgrading-teleport/)
before upgrading to this version.
