## Introduction

Below is a transcript of an interview with our CTO, [Sasha Klizhentas](https://github.com/klizhentas), about his
experience running PostgreSQL on Kubernetes. In this interview, we discuss the
challenges involved, open source and commercial tools that can help and other
alternatives to managing stateful applications on Kubernetes.

For some background, Sasha is a maintainer of the open-source Kubernetes runtime called
[Gravity](https://goteleport.com/gravity/how-it-works/) which allows you to package an entire
cluster into a single file, to distribute and run thousands of identical
Kubernetes clusters autonomously, i.e. when they update themselves.

## Challenges with running Postgres on Kubernetes

**Abe:** If someone wants to run Postgres or a similar database on Kubernetes where should they start?

**Sasha:** It's really hard to do. The hardest thing
in running Postgres on Kubernetes is to understand that Kubernetes is not aware
of the deployment details of Postgres. A naive deployment could lead to
complete data loss.

Here's a typical scenario when that happens. You set up streaming replication
and let's say the first master is up. All the writes go there and they
asynchronously replicate to the standby. Then suddenly the current master goes
down but the asynchronous replication has a huge lag caused by something like a
network partition. If the naive failover leader election algorithm kicks in
or the administrator who doesn't know the state manually triggers failover, the
secondary becomes the master. That becomes the source of truth. All of the data
during that period is lost because all of the writes that were not
replicated disappear. Whenever the admin recovers the first master it's no
longer the master any more and it has to completely sync the state from the
second node which is now the master.

**Abe:** Have you seen this? Seen this with clusters you support at Teleport?

**Sasha:** Yeah, that was a real data loss pattern we saw with asynchronous replication that
caused loss.

**Abe:** You're talking about classic [slony](http://www.slony.info/) or the [streaming replication features](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/warm-standby.html)
that have been built into Postgres since 9.x?

**Sasha:** Asynchronous replication sends operations to the followers / standby nodes.
Those modifications could be changes to the state, writes, or creating new
values. Whenever a chunk of this data is lost there should be a mechanism that
tells the receiving node that its data is out of sync. In Postgres, there is
a mechanism that helps to track replication lag. But there's no
authority that analyzes this data that is built into Postgres, yet, that will
help whoever is doing leader election to complete it.

  election.
</Quote>

The [Citus Data](https://www.citusdata.com/) team, by the
way, handles replication correctly in their integration of Kubernetes with
Postgres. They track replication state and replication lag -
they have it all built in. But, if you are DIY, whoever builds Kubernetes
deployments with failover should keep this in mind. Kubernetes, makes it deceptively easy to implement
basic failover and leader election.
For example, a user can create a deployment with replication factor of one and
that's your leader election.

## Using Kubernetes StatefulSets for Native High Availability

**Abe:** What about [Kubernetes StatefulSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)? If you're coming in just needing a simple
non-HA deployment, is it fair to think, "oh I could use StatefulSets to do this?"

**Sasha:** That's true. It's the simplest deployment that will probably work if
someone has this concept of a volume of
data that travels with the database. The replication is no longer necessary
as-is because if the volume is persistent and it has its own snapshots and
backups there's no need to replicate. However, with on-premises Kubernetes
(which is what we mostly deal with), the implementation of the volumes is
usually based on network filesystems, mounted filesystems like NFS, or
filesystems like Ceph that simulate a block device through object storage. The
clear downside of that is the increased latency. It's really hard to maintain a
large, multi-tenant Ceph cluster and always have low latency for Postgres. You
will probably still encounter data loss.

  That’s the major flaw of all filesystem based replication mechanisms - they
  lack domain specific knowledge about the data type they are replicating and
  whether it’s corrupted or not.
</Quote>

Imagine there are writes and suddenly
Postgres goes down for any number of random reasons. Whatever is replicating those writes for Postgres on behalf
of block storage has no domain specific knowledge about a replication log that
was written to the disk. So it doesn't know what was corrupted or what state
the replication log is and can not successfully recover it. That's the major
flaw of all filesystem based replication mechanisms - they lack domain specific
knowledge about the data type they are replicating and whether it's corrupted
or not.

## Kubernetes opens up additional challenges for managing state

**Abe:** So it sounds like just Postgres in general (or any replicated SQL
database) is just going to be a challenge unless you have specifically
engineered, at a core engine level, for it to be Kubernetes or
orchestrator-aware?

**Sasha:** Think about Kubernetes, in this case, as just a
supporting system that gives you basic building blocks. It can give you the
building block of a process that can be constantly up and be reliably migrated
to another machine if one machine goes down. Or it can give you an invariant of
the single leader out of several process running at any time. Kubernetes is
really good at that. And it removes a lot of friction from engineers building
those systems because before Kubernetes they had to reimplement all of these
patterns themselves every time they would roll Zookeeper or any other
distributed storage system that should exhibit those behaviors or those patterns.

<Quote>
  The building blocks are there but you can still misuse them and have data loss
  as a result. It’s probably even easier to do so because the entry level is now
  lower.
</Quote>

So with Kubernetes, DIY of the orchestration is no longer necessary. You have better building blocks.
But the complex part is to create domain-specific system that takes those
building blocks and properly configures them - knows when to elect a leader or not,
when is it safe, when is it not. The building blocks are there but you can
still misuse them and have data loss as a result. _It's probably even easier to
do so because the entry level is now lower._ Anyone can write a Kubernetes
operator for Postgres but looking at the implementations you can just spot how
they'll lose data.

**Abe:** If I am someone who is shipping some sort of SaaS
product via AWS or GKE - I love the workflow of containers, I love RDS or
Google Cloud SQL. But then I have a large enterprise buyer, or I blow my cloud
budget and absolutely have to deploy to an on-prem datacenter, is your first
instinct to not even use Kubernetes for stateful data? You'd recommend
using bare machines or VMs? Here's your DB, it's special, put it on your SAN?
You would even default to looking for the DBA within the existing enterprise IT
shop and using their existing Postgres knowledge instead of trying to build a
Kubernetes-based solution?

**Sasha:** Yeah, with on-prem, traditional deployments using manual failover and SAN would be easier and safer.
That would be my first choice. I would only try to manage the lifecycle of a stateful workload under an orchestrator if I had no other choice.

**Abe:** Wow, I've worked within a lot of enterprises and I can't
even imagine how long it'd take to get time on that DBA team's backlog.

**Abe:** One of the other interesting things I've heard you say in the past is that
etcd, as soon as it can't fsync fast enough will freeze Kubernetes in its current state. You can't do anything with it.

**Sasha:** Yeah managing distributed database is hard, which is why a DIY approach is challenging.

## Managing Postgres on Kubernetes is a full time job

**Abe:** So what do you do if you absolutely must use Postgres on Kubernetes,
for whatever reason.

<Quote>
  Find a team or solution that is solely focused on Postgres and pair them with
  a team that knows Kubernetes well.
</Quote>

**Sasha:** To wrap up the conversation about Postgres, there
is a way. Find a team or solution that is solely focused on Postgres and pair
them with a team that knows Kubernetes well. I mentioned them earlier but the
team at Citus Data is building a very sophisticated system that [turns Postgres
into a clustered solution](https://www.citusdata.com/product). That's why we eventually ditched the concept of
trying to build our own home-grown system from open source bits and now we're
collaborating with the Citus folks. Just bring them our Kubernetes knowledge
and we're using their Postgres knowledge. Their principal engineer, [Marco Slot](https://github.com/marcocitus),
is a distributed systems expert by training so he knows what he's doing with
Postgres very well and Postgres is the team's core focus.

## When to put stateful workloads on Kubernetes

**Abe:** If you start to rip your database out, or
you don't have database or a distributed systems experts on staff building
Kubernetes clusters, what's the rule of thumb for when you should start
thinking about an orchestrator vs just shipping your MVP without it, worrying
about clustering later. When do you cross that threshold?

<Quote>
  The rule of thumb – that we’ve learned the hard way – with stateful workloads
  is to think very deeply about the problem space before committing to using
  Kubernetes to host it.
</Quote>

**Sasha:** The rule of thumb -- that we've learned the hard way -- with stateful workloads is to think very deeply about the problem
space before committing to using Kubernetes to host it. It's very
tempting but unless you have these specialized domain-specific solutions, it's
not quite practical. The companies that should be looking into Kubernetes to automate their existing HA solutions are specific professionals in their field like Citus or 2ndQuadrant.
Those are the companies that should be looking at Kubernetes. They already know
all of the intricacies of deployments of highly available databases and their
workloads. They should just start using Kubernetes as a faster tool to build
the same primitives they would have built anyway.

For example, Citus have built their own monitoring solution, an agent, that should be running on one of the
nodes that tracks the status. When I talked to them, I suggested they just use
"Kubernetes TPRs" and spin up the deployment with a ReplicaSet of one and your
agent will have consistent view of the world. That's where Kubernetes shines.
But still, all the information that's shipped to this agent should be sent by
them. And state machines that know when to elect, re-elect and all that stuff
should be built by Citus' distributed systems experts.

**Abe:** TPRs? You mean [CRDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions/)? My favorite Helm package maintainer from Wisconsin likes to call them
CURDS. Custom Resource Definitions, they replaced TPRs.

**Sasha:** Ha! Yes, "curds."

## Using NoSQL on Kubernetes

**Abe:** So then the next place my mind
immediately goes to is what about Cassandra or something that's closer to the
actual consistency model that you require for your use case, instead
of just defaulting to a SQL DB? Do you recommend that folks stop thinking of
simply wanting SQL, instead start thinking about how they actually need their
data persisted and how they're using it? Are the operational model of the
NoSQL options are easier to mate with Kubernetes or are you just starting to
mix so many different concerns at that point that...wait, you're giving me
dirty looks!

<Quote>
  The specific database is not really the point. The complexity lies in deeply
  understanding how the database works and the workloads.
</Quote>

**Sasha:** The specific database is not really the point. The
complexity lies in deeply understanding how the database works and the
workloads. Let's say you have a perfect deployment of Postgres right now that
uses asynchronous replication. You will still have edge cases that lose data.

Anyone who wants to deploy Cassandra on Kubernetes should also be aware that Kubernetes
doesn't know anything about Cassandra hinted handoffs and when they should occur.

If you have five nodes and you create a deployment out of them and two
of them went down and you have large dataset, Kubernetes will happily spin up
two more nodes and add them to the cluster. What will likely happen in reality
is that the nodes will start rebalancing the data to the point that the whole cluster
will go down. It will be busy shuffling the data around and won't be able to
serve reads. So that's a good example where Kubernetes has no idea about the
workloads, the distribution of the data or the replication mechanisms.
So there should be a system that uses Kubernetes mostly for the
scheduling bits and Kubernetes should not be the one deciding whether it is
safe or not to add two more replicas.

A good example of an operator that does
this well is the [etcd operator](https://github.com/coreos/etcd-operator).

It is is aware of whether it is safe or not to add nodes, recover the cluster,
if it is broken beyond repair, etc. but it's a lot of work.
If you look at the code base, it's five to ten thousand
lines of code.

## Human operators are still far from obsolete

**Abe:** Is it plausible just to use etcd for storing state directly?

**Sasha:** Maybe, but it's way safer, way easier, more programmatic to
use a conservative deployment of the database for now.

**Abe:** If you were doing pure native etcd by way of CRDs? Essentially you're in the domain of the
distributed systems stuff and then it's safer because you're there?

**Sasha:** If you
host a really loaded database (of any kind), the amount of intelligence and operations
monitoring to make a proper decision is enormous. You have to really know if
it is safe to, lets say, bring down this node, for Postgres or for Cassandra
depending on what type of workload it is. So to get an automatic operator to a
useable state, the workload should be understood well enough so that the
heuristics built in to the operator will always work because there is no human
failsafe.

<Quote>
  DBAs are the operators right now and the intelligence that humans possess and
  the decision making process that they can take with the analysis of the state
  - you have to build something really, really sophisticated to replicate a good
  DBA team.
</Quote>

DBAs are the operators right now and the
intelligence that humans possess and the decision making process that they can
take with the analysis of the state - you have to build something really,
really sophisticated to replicate a good DBA team. Almost like a self-driving
car, in production! And that's where I think the gap in the industry is
right now. Oh Kubernetes will solve all your problems?! No! It will not.
Because you have to be really as smart as the operations person who's spent
five years understanding Postgres.

**Abe:** And you need a PhD in Kubernetes.

**Sasha:** Not PhD, but.

**Abe:** You need to understand the primitives and how it works.

**Sasha:** So imagine you've deployed Postgres inside Kubernetes. Before
you had tools, pgsql, pgtop, and all that stuff. And let's say you want to
build a replica. You use ansible to build your replicas. But if you put this
whole thing inside Kubernetes, then first you have to either reinvent those
tools or second, make them cluster-aware. Hey how do you connect to pg master
now? How do you know, out of this deployment, which
Postgres is the master and which one is the replica? There is no standard way -
you have to build your own automation.

So in a way Kubernetes makes it way more
complex because before everything was static. You had this sensible host file,
this is your leader, these are your followers and everything was clear. But now
you're just looking at this thing and there are three pods. Which one is
leader? You don't know. So you have to go into each one and try to somehow
detect if it is master or not.

**Abe:** One last question. Why do you hate Kubernetes?

**Sasha:** I don't hate it! I use it everyday and it's an amazing
system. I'm just saying that Kubernetes, right now, supports some workloads
really really well, like stateless workloads that are CPU intensive that can
be easily scaled horizontally, with easy to understand patterns that we
currently put behind load balancers.

Other workloads, Kubernetes just doesn't
support well and likely will not support well in the near future because it's
really hard to do. It's not magic, as some of the hype surrounding it would
have you believe.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, unfortunately for those who're looking for an easy answer, there
isn't one.

- Running PostgreSQL or any other stateful application which was not designed
  to run on Kubernetes is still a challenge.
- Consider Kubernetes Stateful Sets, when you must run a database inside a
  Kubernetes cluster.
- Kubernetes offers a solid set of basic building blocks to construct your
  own, reliable operational model for PostgreSQL. To do this well, you need
  someone with a good grasp of Kubernetes concepts and someone who's a
  PostgreSQL expert, there is no easy, re-usable recipe.
