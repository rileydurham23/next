Teleport will be three years old in just a few weeks. Since its public debut in June 2016,
Teleport has been adopted as a PAM solution for SSH by numerous individuals and companies - from start-ups to large enterprises such as banks,
semiconductor manufacturers, stock exchanges and government entities.

While we are happy with what we have achieved, three years is still a very young age
for a priviledged access management product central to cyber security. That is why we remain
committed to regularly performing full security audits (as in "all source
code") by industry-trusted third parties.

Today, we are announcing another full security audit performed by Cure53.

## Who is Cure53?

[Cure53](https://cure53.de) is a team of security researches based in Germany.
We like working with them due to their reputation in auditing open source
projects and the fact that they publish results publicly for the community to see.

You can see some of their reports published on [their web site](https://cure53.de/#publications).

## Audit Findings

The full text of the report (PDF) can be downloaded [here](https://cure53.de/pentest-report_teleport_2.pdf)
The summary of the findings is:

- No critical vulnerabilities have been discovered.
- One _high_ vulnerability was found: The roles API of the auth server allow directory traversal.
- Two medium issues have been discovered.
- Two "info" level issues have been discovered.
- The latest 2.6.0 release already contains patches for these issues.

Quoting from the report:

<Quote>
  Of the five discoveries made during this test, one is considered to be a
  security vulnerability issue, while the other four were classified as general
  weaknesses.
</Quote>

**IMPORTANT:** The discovered issues have been patched and patches were provided for 2.5.x
and 2.4.x series (published as 2.5.8 and 2.4.8)

## Conclusions

Quoting the "Conclusions" section of the report:

<Quote>
  The results of this second-run Cure53 security assessment of the latest
  release of the Teleport software by Teleport Inc are once again very positive.
  With the first Cure53-Teleport collaboration already yielding good results,
  the fact that this time the findings are few and far between across the board
  is very much praiseworthy...
