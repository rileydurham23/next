In our last blog post [How to Pass a FedRAMP Audit for SaaS Providers: Part 1](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-pass-fedramp-audit/), we looked at what FedRAMP is and why it matters for SaaS providers. We also discussed a success story with one publicly traded Teleport SaaS customer who used Teleport to pass their FedRAMP audit.

In this blog post, we will look at the specific controls you need to implement in order to pass your FedRAMP audit. As a reminder, the foundational document governing FedRAMP requirements is called FedRAMP [Security Assessment Framework (SAF)](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Security_Assessment_Framework.pdf). This high-level document covers the process of becoming FedRAMP- compliant, but the technical details of “getting everything right” are described in the publication [Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf) maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

Before preparing for your FedRAMP Audit, you will need to know what level of certification you are going after. FedRAMP categorizes levels of impact as Low, Moderate, and High.

Per [FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/understanding-baselines-and-impact-levels/):

“Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs) are categorized into one of three impact levels: Low, Moderate, and High; and across three security objectives: - - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

- **Confidentiality:** Information access and disclosure includes means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.
- **Integrity:** Stored information is sufficiently guarded against modification or destruction.
- **Availability:** Ensuring timely and reliable access to information.

FedRAMP currently authorizes CSOs at the: Low, Moderate, and High impact levels.”

Most often, when organizations talk about FedRAMP compliance, they are going after Moderate or High. There are currently 325 controls to meet FedRAMP Moderate and 421 to meet FedRAMP High. You can find a complete list on the [FedRAMP website](https://www.fedramp.gov/understanding-baselines-and-impact-levels/). Many of these controls don’t relate to infrastructure access. For those, you will need to work with your team to determine the correct process. For your infrastructure access requirements, there is Teleport.

## FedRAMP compliance for infrastructure

The table below connects Teleport features to FedRAMP requirements. It previews how to tighten controls for Linux & Windows servers, databases, Kubernetes clusters, and internal applications like CI/CD environments when preparing for FedRAMP audits.

        Teleport Enterprise supports robust [Role-based Access Controls (RBAC)](https://goteleport.com/teleport/features/rbac-for-ssh/) to:
        - Control which SSH nodes a user can or cannot access.
        - Control cluster-level configuration (session recording, configuration, etc.)
        - Control which UNIX logins a user is allowed to use when logging into a server.

        <p>Teleport initializes cryptographic keys that act as a Certificate Authority (CA) to further issue x509 and SSH certificates.

SSH host certificates are also signed by the CA and rotated automatically (a manual force rotation can also be performed).</p>
