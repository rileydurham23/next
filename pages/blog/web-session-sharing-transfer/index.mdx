## The need for cross-origin web sessions

Writing a web application that supports securely logging into a website and
managing your credentials is a surprisingly difficult task. You have to develop
a way to manage sessions, understand how browsers store state (cookies), learn
a cryptographically safe password storing technique (like bcrypt), all the
while making sure you mitigate common web security vulnerabilities like
[XSS](https://goteleport.com/blog/xss-attacks/) and
[CSRF](https://goteleport.com/blog/csrf-attacks/).

Even after you've implemented all of the above, you'll still only be logged
into a single application at a single domain, like `example.org`.

What if you are running multiple applications under different domains and you
want to transfer your session state to another domain, like `example.com` or
`acme.com`, how do you implement it in a simple and secure way?

You need to implement a secure way to implement cross-origin session sharing.

## Background

Before getting into too many details, some background on how the web works.

When you log into a website, say `example.org`, you typically send a HTTP POST
request with your username and password to the website. The website will take
your password and pass it through a [Key Derivation Function (KDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) like bcrypt and (constant time)
compares it against the one you used during registration. The server will
generate a large opaque token, store it in a database, then transfer it to the
browser to store as state for `example.org` in the form of a cookie.

This opaque bearer token is sent to the browser in a `Set-Cookie` header. The
`Set-Cookie` header is limited however. You can't simply send it as a response
to any request. For example, you can't have `example.org` reply with a 302
redirect to `acme.com` with a `Set-Cookie` header to pass your logged in state
from `example.org` to `acme.com`.

You could set a cookie on `.example.org` (note the extra dot) that would allow
subdomains to access it, but this has its own issues: you could inadvertently
leak your session cookies to unintended subdomain and it still does not solve
the problem of transferring sessions between entirely different domains.

## Query Parameters

Using the query parameters approach is a simple and effective way to transfer
credentials from one domain to another. The server generates a large random
token and uses query parameters to pass this token from one domain to another.
Because this token is large enough to be unguessable, the receiving server will
consider any request with a valid token as valid. For example, you might start
at `example.org` and be redirected to `example.com/?token=CCFB3DFB`. Since
both are part of the same parent application, example.com can check that
`CCFB3DFB` is a valid token and exchange it for a valid session.

_Figure 1: Example of query-parameter-based approach._

This approach is technically sound but has a major downside: [cross-domain HTTP Referer leakage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Referer_header:_privacy_and_security_concerns).
More generally, even if all involved domains were fully trusted, the problem
may still arise in the form of a log leak.

When `example.org` issues the 302 redirect, the browser will issue a HTTP GET
request to example.com with the token in the request line. Putting sensitive
data in the request line, be it in the path or a query parameter, has a high
chance of ending up being logged somewhere before it hits the target server.

While the example given below in Figure (2) looks like process logs on disk,
logs are also frequently ingested into systems like Elasticsearch that allow
that data to be viewed by a much larger number of users.

This substantially increases the chances of a security breach. For example, you
may have given users that don't ordinarily have access to sensitive data access
to session cookies or maybe even an attacker of the internal application is not
sufficiently locked down because it's not part of the core product and "just
logs."

```
10.10.10.1 - 200 GET /index.html
10.10.10.1 - 200 GET /image.png
10.10.10.1 - 200 GET /login?token=CCFB3DFB
```

## Fragments

To mitigate this issue, we would have to find a technique that doesn't send
data to servers and lets us pass data from one origin to another. The first
requirement rules out the query parameter approach we outlined above and the
second requirement rules out
[cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/cookies)
and
[localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

When we reached out about this problem to security researchers at
[Doyensec](https://www.doyensec.com/), they recommended using
[fragments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/hash). While
fragments were designed to link to a specific location within a document, the
key for us was that they were not sent by browsers to servers and can be passed
(and read by clients) from one origin to another.

For example, consider this flow:

1. Suppose you start at `example.org/login/example.com` where the application
   has already obtained a token `123` to be used to create a session at
   `example.com`.
2. Your browser will then be redirected to example.com, e.g. by a JavaScript
   instruction `window.location = example.com/auth#token=123`.
3. At `example.com/auth` your browser will receive a small JavaScript
   application as in Figure (3) which reads in the token fragment. 4. Finally
   the application performs a HTTP POST to `example.com`. Since you are now
   within the same domain, `Set-Cookie` will be able to set cookies. A session
   has been successfully transferred from `example.org` to `example.com`.

        if (hashParts.length !== 2 || hashParts[0] !== '#token') {

        }
        const data = {
          token: hashParts[1],
        };

          if (response.ok) {
            // Redirect to the root and remove current URL from
            // history (back button).
            window.location.replace('/');
          }
        });
      })();
    </script>

```

This appears to solve all of our problems, we were able to pass data
cross-origin without sending anything server-side. However, one problem still
remained: login CSRF.

### Mitigating Login CSRF

Those that have read our previous post on
[CSRF](https://goteleport.com/blog/csrf-attacks/) might already see the
problem. Imagine a situation where the attacker is a malicious insider. The
attacker can login to an application they legitimately have access to and
extract a valid session cookie (it's stored client-side after all). If the
attacker can convince the victim to click on a malicious link, they can log you
into their own account. This class of attack is known as “login CSRF” or
“forced login”.

In fact, all the attacker has to do is redirect the user to the redirector
application in Figure (3) by having the victim click on a link to
`example.com/auth#token=123`, where `123` is the value associated with the
attacker's session, and our application would do the rest for them. The victim
would get silently logged in to the attacker's account, enabling the attacker
to monitor the victim's activity, steal any confidential information entered
and otherwise interfere with the victim's actions.

The crux of the problem is that as long as `example.com` is limited to sitting
passively on the receiving end, it will never be able to distinguish between a
fragment that is submitted as part of a full exchange between `example.org`
and `example.com`, and a fragment that has been injected by directly triggering
a later step of the authentication exchange.

We will therefore introduce another parameter — let's call it `state`. It is a
short-lived and non-predictable value generated by `example.com` for each
exchange with `example.org`. The fragment sent to `example.com` during the
exchange will have to be accompanied by the expected `state` in order for the
fragment to be accepted and transformed into a session. Indeed, the parameter's
name is a reference to [OAuth state parameters](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/state-parameters)
which involve a rather similar technique.

Our example flow from the previous section then gets a little more complicated:

1. Once again, you would start at `example.org/login/example.com` where the
   application has already obtained a token `123` to be used to create a
   session at `example.com`.
2. Because you don't know the state value yet, the fragment itself isn't sent
   either, so your browser will be redirected to a special URL
   `example.com/auth-init`, intended to give example.com a little nudge
   initiating an authentication exchange.
3. At example.com the server-side handler of the `/auth-init` endpoint will
   generate new state value (e.g., xyz), store it in your browser as a
   `example.com`-specific cookie (with a short time-to-live, e.g. one minute;
   it also has to be set with `SameSite=None`).
4. Afterwards the state value can be passed back to `example.org` by
   redirecting to `example.org/login/example.com?state=xyz`
5. You're now basically back at Step #1 but with a valid state value in hand!
   Hence unlike before, it is now possible to provide `example.com/auth` with
   all the necessary information and redirect to
   `example.com/auth?state=xyz#token=123`.
6. Now `example.com` detects both of the needed parameters and sends a
   JavaScript application to your browser (see Figure 5). The handler of the
   HTTP POST endpoint compares the supplied `state` with the one stored in the
   short-lived cookie. If the two values match, the `token` fragment can be
   finally accepted and transformed into a session at `example.com`. A session
   has been successfully transferred from `example.org` to `example.com`.

_Figure 4: Diagrammatic depiction of the login CSRF resistant flow._

The reason that this flow prevents login CSRF attempts is that it helps the
target application `example.com` make sure the session comes from the user
logged in at `example.org` right then and there. Without the knowledge of the
short-lived `state` value saved in the victim's browser, the attacker can do
nothing but make the victim go through all the motions of the authentication
exchange, which is in itself harmless.

A more attentive reader might ask: Why is it suddenly OK to pass `state` as a
regular `GET` query parameter whereas above, while discussing the query
implementation, we argued it could serve as a possible attack surface? The most
important factor is that, unlike the tokens used before, the `state` values are
valid just for a brief amount of time. That said, the design can be easily
adapted to embed the `state` value in the fragment as well.

Note that the above solution is effective only as long as the attacker has no
other means of setting a cookie at `example.com`. If, for example, there was
another cookie injection vulnerability or a malicious subdomain owner was able
to manipulate cookies of the main domain, the possibility of login CSRF
wouldn't be entirely eliminated.

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

A more direct solution to the problem of transferring sessions across different
domains could be built using the client-side mechanism of [Cross-Origin
Resource Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).
Its purpose is to guide browsers when accessing or modifying cross-origin
resources. By default, such actions are blocked, but appropriate HTTP headers
sent by (often cooperating) web servers can convince the browser to perform
them in a safe and standardized fashion. Even though this technology is
supported by all mainstream browsers, our use case of setting [third party
cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#Third-party_cookies)
can still be rejected by regular policies which is why we opted in for the more
reliable (albeit less elegant) solution described above.

The core idea is to combine the two steps of redirecting to `example.com/auth`
with the tokens followed by the execution of the self-POST request (recall
Figure 4) into a single fetch call made directly from
`example.org/login/example.com` (see Figure 5).

```
        fetch('https://example.com.com/auth', {
          method: 'POST',
          mode: 'cors',
          credentials: 'include',
          cache: 'no-store',
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({token: 123}),
        }).then(response => {
          if (response.ok) {
            // Redirect to the root and remove current URL from
            // history (back button).
            window.location.replace('/');
          }
        })
```

Figure 5: Fetch call from `example.org/login/example.com`.

This would send a cross-origin request capable of sending and setting cookies
associated with `example.com`. To indicate to the browser that requests of this
form are allowed, `example.com/auth` has to respond with the following HTTP
headers, not only for POST but also for OPTIONS because of implicit pre-flights
sent by the browser:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.org
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST
```

With this approach, much of the auxiliary machinery we had to use above (the
/auth-init endpoint, the state value itself, ...) is not needed anymore. Login
CSRF is prevented because only requests originating from `example.org` are
permitted to set cookies at `example.com`.

## Conclusion

If you've read this far, you'll recognize this is the exact same problem we ran
into with [Teleport Application Access](https://goteleport.com/application-access/)
and was one reason why we had to issue the Teleport 5.2.1 security release.

Teleport, for those who've never heard of it, is an [open source](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport)
project which allows users to securely access several web apps running behind
NAT with a single login, without having to expose them to public network, thus
eliminating the headache of managing DNS records, public IPs and x509
certificates.

Managing credentials on the web is difficult; managing credentials cross-origin
is even more difficult. Hopefully, this post has shed some light on how you can
safely add this same functionality to your own application.
