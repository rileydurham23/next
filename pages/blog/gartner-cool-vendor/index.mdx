Today we are happy to announce that Teleport has been included as a Cool Vendor in Gartner Cool Vendors in Identity-First Security report.

_"We believe Teleport’s inclusion in the Identity-First Security Report by Gartner is confirmation that Teleport solves a huge problem of
accessing cloud-native resources that traditional PAM tools did not,"_ said Ev Kontsevoy, co-founder and CEO of Teleport. “Our approach of
leveraging user identity natively on the protocol level enables us to resolve the inherent conflict between productivity and security, so
both engineers and security professionals can be happy.”

According to the Gartner full report, _"digital transformation and the increasing reliance on remote business continue to accelerate the
adoption of new IAM technologies designed to meet business agility demands."_ Teleport has seen a rapid increase in demand since its
inception in 2018, and the unforeseen shift to remote work in just the past year alone demonstrated its value, for developers and engineers
specifically, across organizations that need secure, remote access to infrastructure at all times.

The Identity-First Security Report also states that _“there is demand for improving governance and strengthening privileged access
management across cloud and on-premises environments.”_

Teleport's inclusion affirms that it not only provides added layers of assurance for leaders managing security and risk management
challenges, but that this is done without hindering the access developers need to work efficiently.

Teleport 1.0 was originally launched in 2016 as an open source project on Github. The first version empowered engineers to access SSH
servers behind NAT across all computing environments using industry best practices for remote access.

Teleport 6.0 was released in March 2021. It was designed to provide PostgreSQL and MySQL users with convenient access to databases running
on private networks, while preventing data exfiltration, compliance enforcement and visibility into access and behavior. The next major
version is expected to be released in July 2021.
