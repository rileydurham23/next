    Security flaws, hackers and data breaches are the new normal. It’s not just those of us in the
    industry facing these foes every single day; it’s everyone. Whether you’re online or offline,
    you simply cannot exist today without your personal information being digitized in systems which
    are often left vulnerable and exploited at the whim of attackers. But who are these people — the
    ones who seek to break through our defenses and exploit our data? And how are they continually so
    effective at doing so, despite our best efforts?

    In this talk, you’ll hear from the creator of “Have I Been Pwned” about the lessons he’s learned
    after processing more than 11B records of breached data. You’ll get a glimpse behind the scenes
    of what caused some of these devastating incidents and how they continue to wreak havoc today,
    despite how much more aware the industry is becoming. It’s a frightening, eye-opening and entertaining
    look at infosec and data breaches.

  Fast-growth companies are some of the richest targets for hackers because that’s where the user data is. How do you balance the security you need to protect your customers/users with the agility you need to build a business? This talk provides practical tips drawn from Michael Coates' experience as CISO of an iconic brand with hundreds of millions of users. The talk will also explore current threats, data breaches, and the new reality of risk to identify what security controls are actually needed for enterprises that are moving fast, leaning into new technology, and want effective security defenses.

  In 2022, Cyber Security is no longer about protecting secrets. It is about our way of life that relies on digital technology everywhere: from clouds to smartphones, from medical facilities to stock markets, and everything in between. In the past 2 years threat actors have innovated faster than ever before, even using “growth hacking” tricks to increase the impact of their criminal enterprises. At the same time, our own connected lifestyle and digital footprint keep changing at breakneck speeds. How can we prepare for what comes next? By learning from hackers! Keren Elazari — security researcher, TED speaker, and friendly hacker — joins us for a conversation on emerging security threats, new attack vectors and techniques, and innovation lessons we can learn from hackers.
