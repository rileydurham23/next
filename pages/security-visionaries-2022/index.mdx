    Computer security is no longer about data; it's about life and property. This 
    change makes an enormous difference, and will shake up our industry in many ways. 
    First, data authentication and integrity will become more important than confidentiality. 
    And second, our largely regulation-free Internet will become a thing of the past.

    Soon we will no longer have a choice between government regulation and no government regulation. 
    Our choice is between smart government regulation and stupid government regulation. Given this future, 
    it's vital that we look back at what we've learned from past attempts to secure these systems, and 
    forward at what technologies, laws, regulations, economic incentives, and social norms we need to 
    secure them in the future.

    Security flaws, hackers and data breaches are the new normal. It’s not just those of us in the 
    industry facing these foes every single day; it’s everyone. Whether you’re online or offline, 
    you simply cannot exist today without your personal information being digitized in systems which 
    are often left vulnerable and exploited at the whim of attackers. But who are these people — the 
    ones who seek to break through our defenses and exploit our data? And how are they continually so 
    effective at doing so, despite our best efforts?

    In this talk, you’ll hear from the creator of “Have I Been Pwned” about the lessons he’s learned 
    after processing more than 11B records of breached data. You’ll get a glimpse behind the scenes 
    of what caused some of these devastating incidents and how they continue to wreak havoc today, 
    despite how much more aware the industry is becoming. It’s a frightening, eye-opening and entertaining 
    look at infosec and data breaches.

  Our collective cybersecurity posture is dramatically different from 18 months ago. New and clever data breaches pepper the news and the security industry megaphone touts numerous new defensive technologies. We will explore current threats, data breaches, and the new reality of risk to identify what security controls are actually needed for enterprises that are moving fast, leaning into new technology, and want effective security defenses
