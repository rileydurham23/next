    title="Certificate Auth for SSH & K8s"
    href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/how-it-works/certificate-based-authentication-ssh-kubernetes/"

    Managing static SSH keys can lead to increased operational overhead and may
    lead to security vulnerabilities. The industry best practice is to use
    certificate-based authentication for SSH and Kubernetes.

    href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/how-it-works/secure-kubernetes-access/"
  >
    Teleport works by being a unified gateway for both Kubernetes and SSH
    sessions. This allows to synchronize SSO, role-based access controls and
    audit logging for both protocols.
