    <ProductBanner.Item title="Identity-based access" >
      Teleport enforces the use of auto-expiring x.509 certificates tied to user identities, instead of static or shared credentials for access to your database.
    </ProductBanner.Item>
    <ProductBanner.Item title="Access requests" >
      Move away from admin accounts with just-in-time privilege escalation for administrative tasks. Access requests can be approved via Slack or other supported plugins.
    </ProductBanner.Item>
    <ProductBanner.Item title="Consolidated policy" >
      Consolidate policy for role-based access to all  database instances across all environments in one place. This increases security and reduces operational overhead.
