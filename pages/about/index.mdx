<History>
  <History.Milestone icon="pc">
    Teleport founders **fell in love** with **programming** by giving a computer
    some instructions and watching the magic happen. The **close relationship**
    between a programmer, a machine, and code felt special.
  </History.Milestone>
  <History.Milestone icon="graduate">
    We **went to college** and **joined the workforce**. We even launched our
    own startups and witnessed the transition of programming from one machine to
    many and eventually to cloud computing. This brought enormous complexities
    into our lives. Half of our effort now goes towards erecting and
    continuously maintaining complex "**cloud environments**" for our programs.
  </History.Milestone>
  <History.Milestone icon="security">
    Each environment consists of numerous layers of computing resources, each
    with its own trust model, often separated by network boundaries and
    overburdened with excessive configuration. Not only is this complexity
    **slowing us down**, but it is also prone to human errors, resulting in
    **poor security**.
  </History.Milestone>
  <History.Milestone icon="laptop">
    We started the company because we found this **mess** with
    environments…**unpleasant**. We liked the simplicity of giving instructions
    to a computer better. Can we have that in **the modern era of cloud
    computing**?
  </History.Milestone>
  <History.Milestone icon="jet">
    We believe the **answer is yes**, but we have to let go of environments and
    leap into **environment-free computing**, i.e. fully embrace the promise of
    the cloud and treat the entire planet as a single, multi-tenant computer.
    That computer needs a simple and secure **access plane**.
  </History.Milestone>
</History>

<Manifesto>
  Today's **computing environments** have too much complexity, too many network
  boundaries, and too little trust. Complexity slows engineers down and leads to
  human errors. Complex systems can’t be secure despite the red tape of
  bureaucracy. We make trusted computing **simple**. This gives engineers
  **freedom to move and freedom to build a better future**.
</Manifesto>

    title="We believe in being paid for quality work"
  >
    There's an incredible amount of software infrastructure that is under-funded
    and ignored. We believe our software needs to generate revenue to employ the
    best minds.

    title="We balance openness and transparency"
  >
    We work as much as we can in the open; our commits, designs, and comments
    are largely in public repositories for anyone to use and observe. We strive
    to find balance in open-core and community-friendly software versus
    competing in a dynamic and evolving market segment. All our security
    critical code is developed in the open. Our independent audits get
    published, even the unflattering ones.

    title="We want to tackle and solve the hard problems"
  >
    We want to minimize the theater in security products, and offer meaningful
    improvements to security posture. We want to focus on the user, having a
    product that users aren't trying to work around to get their jobs done. We
    want to end passwords as a vehicle for trust, including passwords in
    disguise such as tokens.
