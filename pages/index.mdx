        Teleport is easy to deploy and use. We believe that simplicity and good

        Teleport is open source and it relies on open standards such as SSH, HTTPS,
        SAML, OpenID connect and others. Deployed as a single-binary drop-in replacement
        for OpenSSH, it seamlessly integrates with the rest of your stack.

        <p>
          The days of trading off agility for security are over.
          Security-software done right gets out of the way, improving
          productivity while protecting critical infrastructure. The key is
          simplicity. Easy-to-use software is essential to first-class security
          because it reduces the risk of a human error. Teleport embodies the
          principle of simplicity in everything that we do. This is why the
          fastest growing, most innovative companies in the world choose
          Teleport. NASDAQ, Snowflake, Square and many more know that when it
          comes to security and employee productivity, there is no tradeoff.
          There is Teleport.
