      <>
        <p>
        Security software done right gets out of the way, improving productivity while protecting critical infrastructure.
        The key is simplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
        Easy-to-use software is essential to first-class security because it reduces the risk of a human error.
        Teleport embodies the principle of simplicity in everything that we do.
        This is why the fastest growing, most innovative companies choose Teleport.
