    <H2 color="black" pt={4}>What is SSH (Secure Shell Protocol)?</H2>

    SSH is a cryptographic protocol for connecting to network services over an unsecured network. Common applications for SSH are remote login
    and remotely executing commands on hosts, but that only scratches the surface of what you can do with SSH.

    A key benefit of SSH is its near ubiquity. With OpenSSH having been released back in 1999, SSH can be found on nearly every Operating
    System. SSH applications are based on a client-server architecture, with a SSH client connecting to a SSH Server. Let’s look at a simple
    example: I’ve created a new server on a cloud provider. During setup, I had to provide my SSH keys, or more specifically my SSH Public Key.
    When the server is booted, this key is added to the server, the server boots and the SSH Server process waits for a connection. I’m now able
    to connect to the host using SSH, `ssh ubunutu@host`, almost transparently. My local terminal feels as if I was 
    [plugged into the host with a monitor](https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-handshake-explained/). 

    SSH is a protocol, not a product. The protocol covers 3 main areas.

    - Authentication
        - Authentication involves proving a user or a machine’s identity; that is, who they claim to be. For SSH, this means confirming that
          the user has the correct credentials to access the SSH Server. 

    - Encryption
        - SSH is an encrypted protocol, so the data is unintelligible except to the intended recipients. 

    - Integrity
        - SSH guarantees that the data traveling over the network arrives unaltered. If a third party was to modify traffic during transit, SSH
          would detect this.

    <H2 color="black" pt={4}>What can you SSH into?</H2>

    SSH can be used to access any computer. While the primary use was to connect to servers, the definition of “compute” has become more
    ubiquitous. For example, there are even very small SSH Servers, such as Dropbear SSH that only needs 110kb of space, designed for
    “embedded”-type Unix systems such as routers and IoT devices. You can even [SSH into a self-driving vehicle](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-ssh-into-a-self-driving-vehicle/).

    <H2 color="black" pt={4}>What is OpenSSH?</H2>

    OpenSSH is an OpenBSD project — it was the [first fork](https://www.openssh.com/history.html/) of the original and now proprietary SSH program developed by Tatu Ylönen. SSH is a
    generic term, and for the rest of the article when we say “SSH” we are referring to the protocol. referenced as the protocol. OpenSSH is
    still [actively maintained](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html/) and is included in most major UNIX distributions. If you type `ssh`, you’ll most likely be interacting with
    OpenSSH. Try typing `ssh -V` to find your current version. 

    OpenSSH is a powerful tool, but there are a lot of features that should be avoided — if you set it up incorrectly, bad things will happen.
    This is why we recommend following these steps to make sure you are following [SSH best practices](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-ssh-properly/). There are other issues you might
    encounter, such as the trust on first use (TOFU) problem or adding RBAC to connections. Using an open source product such as 
    [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/blog/openssh-vs-teleport/) can help fill these gaps. 

    <H2 color="black" pt={4}>SSH public/private keys</H2>

    By default SSH runs on port 22, and it’s common to open the port up to the whole internet. This means it’s a common target for hackers to
    probe SSH. If you’re using a SSH password, there will be many brute-force attacks. This is why it’s recommended to use `ssh keygen` to
    create strong authentication keys for SSH. Learn more about [how to set up SSH keys](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys/), and you might want to consider adding a 
    [second factor to SSH authentication](https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-2fa-tutorial/), in case someone gets a hold of your keys. If implementing passwordless SSH, it’s important to understand the 
    [pros and cons of the options available to you](https://goteleport.com/blog/comparing-passwordless-ssh-authentication-methods/). 

    When creating an SSH Key, there are a bunch of options. [Should you use RSA, DSA, ECDSA, or EdDSA?](https://goteleport.com/blog/comparing-ssh-keys/) For a while, it was a choice between RDA
    2047/4096 and ED25519, but after [AWS started supporting ED25519 keys](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/08/amazon-ec2-customers-ed25519-keys-authentication/), this would be our recommendation. 
    
   <H2 color="black" pt={4}>SSH client configuration The SSH</H2>

    Client is a tool used on your laptop, workstation or even mobile device. Depending on your OS, you’ll have SSH installed by default. If
    using Windows, you’ll have to [pick a SSH client](https://goteleport.com/blog/choosing-ssh-client-windows/) if you’re not using WSL. After you’ve made your first few connections, you’ll quickly want
    to edit your SSH configuration, to increase security and productivity. For example, creating an alias for ‘ssh dev’, that'll configure the
    user and set up the correct agent forwarding. For a full list of the  SSH configuration, check out our [ssh_config guide](https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-config/).

        <H2 color="black" pt={4}>SSH Server</H2>

        The SSH Server is the program that runs on the device you want to connect to. It could be a ‘server’ but can also be an embedded device.
        Since SSH is a protocol, the program could be from a [range of different SSH Servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_servers/), with most having some kind of interoperability. For
        example, it’s possible to [Teleport with OpenSSH](https://goteleport.com/docs/server-access/guides/openssh/). 

        Because the SSH server is the gateway to your machine, it’s worth double checking that all [SSH activity is audited](https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-audit/) and that logs can’t be
        manipulated. While /var/log/auth.log provides some basic information about a SSH session, it might miss on activity during the session; it's
        worth setting up [SSH Session recording](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-record-ssh-sessions/). If you only have a couple of hosts, you 
        might want to consider hardening [SSH to prevent brute-force attacks](https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-hardening-to-prevent-brute-force-attacks/), 
        or using [SSH port knocking](https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-port-knocking/).

        <H2 color="black" pt={4}>SSH certificates</H2>

        The next level up from SSH keys is SSH certificates. OpenSSH has supported the use of certificates since 
        [OpenSSH 5.4](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-5.4/) which was released back in 2010.

        With SSH certificates, you generate a certificate authority (CA) and then use this to issue and cryptographically sign certificates which
        can authenticate users to hosts, or hosts to users. There are a few unique properties of certificates that greatly improve security. For
        example, since [SSH certificates](https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-certificates/) can be issued on-demand, this makes it easy to only provide a certificate for that period of time, and after
        that, the certificate will automatically expire. When someone logs in for the day, they can get an 8-hour certificate. The next day they’ll
        need to re-authenticate to get a new certificate. 

        The second benefit is the ability to link certificates to a user and [their identity](https://goteleport.com/blog/identity-based-access-for-ssh/). By linking a cert to a user, it becomes easy to figure
        out who accessed which system and provide fine-grained RBAC for which systems they can access.

        <H2 color="black" pt={4}>SSH agent</H2>
        
        The SSH agent (ssh-agent) is a SSH key manager that stores the SSH key in a process memory so that users can log into SSH servers
        without having to type the key’s passphrase every time they authenticate with the server. In addition to the key management feature, SSH
        agent supports agent forwarding, which helps to authenticate with servers that sit behind a bastion or jump server. 

        There is a risk in using an SSH agent — you should never forward your SSH agent on a machine you do not trust. Although the private keys
        never leave your machine when using the SSH agent, the agent itself is forwarded to the jump server in a forwarding mode. Thus, anyone with
        root access to that jump server can communicate with the agent, impersonate you as an authentic user, and access any servers where the key
        is authorized. 

        We recommend taking a few steps to review how you use an SSH agent and make sure you’re [using it safely](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-use-ssh-agent-safely/).

    <H2 color="black" pt={4}>Secure Copy Protocol (SCP). Secure File Transfer</H2>
    
    SCP is a handy tool for transferring files over SSH, providing easy commands to transfer
    files from and to hosts; for example, using `scp local_file.txt remote_host:/home`. While SCP is as ubiquitous as SSH, it has many security
    and performance issues. We have a post that [deep dives into SCP and provides a few better and modern alternatives](https://goteleport.com/blog/scp-familiar-simple-insecure-slow/).

        SSH tunnels let you proxy arbitrary traffic over SSH. With local port forwarding, SSH tunnels let us connect to insecure
        protocols, securely access remote services, or even bypass content filters by using dynamic port forwarding. We have an in-depth 
        [guide to SSH tunnels](https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-tunneling-explained/), how they work and a few ideas for what to use them for.

    <H2 color="black" pt={4}>SSH production best practices</H2>
    
    It’s a best practice to not directly connect to machines, but instead access them through a bastion or 
    [jump server](https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-jump-server/). Bastions can be hardened machines that can be placed on the internet and can become the gateway to accessing the rest of your fleet.
    If you are looking for a quick guide on creating an SSH bastion, read our post on [setting up an SSH Bastion](https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-bastion-host/) or our in-depth post on 
    [SSH bastion host best practices](https://goteleport.com/blog/security-hardening-ssh-bastion-best-practices/). Implementing 
    [certificate-based authentication is also considered the best method](https://goteleport.com/blog/comparing-passwordless-ssh-authentication-methods/) among password-based, key-based and host-based authentication.
