title: Teleport State of Infrastructure Access and Security Report 2021
description: "The 2021 State of Infrastructure Access and Security Report seeks to better understand the challenges facing IT, DevOps and security professionals. Featuring survey data from 1,000 respondents, the Report offers a representative sample of the common beliefs held by industry professionals, as well as the actions being taken to maintain security in an era of unparalleled complexity.

This dramatic increase in complexity has made the challenge of securing the network perimeter go from difficult to nearly impossible. Meanwhile, the massive employee turnover now known as the “Great Resignation” has dramatically increased the risk of former employees maintaining access to company infrastructure.
