## Overview of Open Core vs Proprietary SaaS

Taylor Wakefield, presents at the 2019 Open Core Summit, comparing Commercial Open Source Software (COSS aka, Open Core
Software) to Proprietary SaaS. This presentation discusses why SaaS emerged, why COSS is now emerging and looks at the

model can produce outstanding results.)
