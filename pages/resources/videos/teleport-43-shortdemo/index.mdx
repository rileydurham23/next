## Teleport Official Demo

This short video shows the basic capabilities of Teleport, Quickly access any computing resource anywhere .

Teleport comes as three binaries: the teleport daemon, the `tsh` client, and the `tctl` administration tool. They are dependency-free,
written in a compiled language, and run on any UNIX-compatible operating system, such as Linux, FreeBSD, or macOS. Teleport is open source
under the Apache 2 license and the source code is available on Github.

Teleport is easy to deploy. It is a traditional Linux daemon similar to sshd and usually runs as a systemd service.
