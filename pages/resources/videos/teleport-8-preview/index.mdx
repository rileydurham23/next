## Teleport Official Preview 
This short video shows the basic capabilities of Teleport, the easiest, most secure way to access all your infrastructure.

Teleport comes as three binaries: the teleport daemon, the <code>tsh</code> client, 
and the <code>tctl</code> administration tool. They are dependency-free, written in a 
compiled language, and run on any UNIX-compatible operating system, such as Linux, FreeBSD,
or macOS. Teleport is open source under the Apache 2 license and the source code is 
available on [Github](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport). 

Teleport is easy to deploy. It is a traditional Linux daemon similar to sshd and usually 
runs as a systemd service.

For more details see [how it works](/teleport/how-it-works/).
