## What is SOC2?

SOC2 or Service Organization Controls were developed by the American
Institute of CPAs (AICPA). They are based on five trust service areas:
security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and privacy.
Teleport helps, in part, with all five trust service areas and is a key
component of how our company achieved SOC2 Type 2 compliance. With
Teleport, we were able to implement a Beyond Corp, Zero Trust organization
that met compliance requirements without slowing developers down.

SOC Auditors look at 17 criteria (also known as principles) developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
Teleport is designed to help satisfy two principle areas:

- CC6: Logical and Physical Access Controls
- CC7 System Operations

Each principle has many "Points of Focus" which will apply differently to
different products and organizations. Talk to an auditor to understand
exactly which points of focus apply.

## SOC2 Compliance for SSH and Kubernetes Access

Below is a table of principles and common points of focus listed by <a
href="https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/downloadabledocuments/trust-services-criteria.pdf">AICPA’s
official “trust Service Criteria” Document </a> and how Teleport helps
satisfy them.
