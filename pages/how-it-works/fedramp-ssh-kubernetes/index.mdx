## Introduction

Modern cloud software is complex. It requires multiple computers or data
centers and teams of engineers for building and maintenance. Securing complex
systems and avoiding data breaches requires making solid engineering
decisions, but also _having robust processes and procedures in place to
address the unavoidable human factor_.

Imagine a group of security professionals that compiled a list of
common-sense recommendations that have been proven to work. A compliance
standard is not an annoying and boring obstacle to productivity. Think about
it as just one of those lists, that has a name and tied to a well-known group
of authors.

## What is FedRAMP?

FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) originally  was proposed as a standardized approach for the federal government to adopt secure cloud services offered by the cloud providers. FedRAMP is a product of collaboration with multiple government agencies, such as NIST, GSA, DOD, and DHS.

While the original focus of FedRAMP was on cloud infrastructure (i.e. things like virtual networks, servers, and firewalls), eventually it was applied to cloud applications as well.

If your organization is currently or planning to offer cloud infrastructure or cloud software services to the federal government, you must have your software running on a FedRAMP-compliant cloud service provider (CSP) and your software must be able to pass FedRAMP audit by an independent auditor.

Just like SOC 3, FedRAMP introduces its own vocabulary. The foundational document is called FedRAMP <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Security_Assessment_Framework.pdf">Security Assessment Framework</a> (SAF). This high-level document covers the process of becoming FedRAMP compliant, but the technical details of “getting everything right” are described in a publication called <em>Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations</em> <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf">NIST 800-53</a>. It is maintained by the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST).

FedRAMP requirements described in NIST publications are labeled with the severity of their impact: low, medium, or high. Each government agency is free to decide which level of compliance they desire. That is why terms are “FedRAMP medium” are frequently used.

## FedRAMP compliance for SSH and Kubernetes Access

Just like with <a href="../soc2-ssh-kubernetes/">SOC 2</a>, NIST 800-53 groups all requirements into “families” with unique identifiers (ID):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>ID</th>
      <th>Family</th>
      <th>ID</th>
      <th>Family</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>AC</th>
      <td>Access Control</td>
      <th>MP</th>
      <td>Media Protection</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>AT</th>
      <td>Awareness and Training</td>
      <th>PE</th>
      <td>Physical and Env. Protection</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>AU</th>
      <td>Audit and Accountability</td>
      <th>PL</th>
      <td>Planning</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>CA</th>
      <td>Security Assessment &amp; Authorization</td>
      <th>PS</th>
      <td>Personnel Security</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>CM</th>
      <td>Configuration Management</td>
      <th>RA</th>
      <td>Risk Assessment</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>IA</th>
      <td>Identification and Authentication</td>
      <th>SA</th>
      <td>System and Services Acquisition</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>IR</th>
      <td>Incident Response</td>
      <th>SI</th>
      <td>System and Information Integrityt</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>MA</th>
      <td>Maintenance</td>
      <th>PM</th>
      <td>Program Management</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  
</table>
&nbsp;  
Obviously, families like personnel security or physical and environmental protection are outside the scope of Teleport, but Access control, Identification, Authentication, and Audit definitely fall within Teleport’s area of responsibilities.


## FedRAMP Compliance for SSH and Kubernetes
The table below connects Teleport features to FedRAMP and SOC 2 requirements. It previews how to tighten SSH and Kubernetes access when preparing for FedRAMP and SOC 2 audits.

## Conclusion  

Note that not all relevant NIST requirements are listed above.  

As Teleport’s design goal was to provide sensible choices by default, it enforces most of the best practices automatically without additional configuration.
