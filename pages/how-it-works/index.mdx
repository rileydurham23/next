## The Basics

Teleport is an identity-aware, multi-protocol access proxy which 
implements protocols such as SSH, RDP,  HTTPS, Kubernetes API, MySQL, 
PostgreSQL and others. It is completely transparent to client-side tools 
and designed to work with everything in today's DevOps ecosystem.


Inside the [downloaded tarball](/teleport/download/), you will find three
binaries: the `teleport` daemon, the `tsh` client, and the `tctl` administration tool.
They are dependency-free, written in a compiled language. Teleport is
open source and the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/" target="_blank">Github</a>.

## Teleport Architecture

The key concept of Teleport architecture is a "cluster". A Teleport cluster is
a collection of resources such as servers, remote devices, databases,
Kubernetes clusters or internal web apps.

Clients must authenticate with Teleport and receive a client certificate which
automatically works for all resources in a cluster, i.e. after authentication
`ssh`, `kubectl`, `psql`, `mysql` and other remote access commands will be
configured with user's identity.

Teleport offers a built-in database of users but for production use we
recommend integrating it with enterprise SSO based on Okta, Github, Google
Apps, Active Directory and other identity providers.

To create a minimal Teleport cluster, you must launch three services:

- **Teleport Auth Service**. The certificate authority of the cluster. It issues certificates to clients and maintains the audit log.
- **Teleport Proxy Service**. The proxy allows access to cluster resources from the outside. Typically it is the only service available from the public network.
- **Teleport Node**. A Teleport node is like "sshd on steroids". The node
  service runs near a target resource and speaks its native protocol such as
  SSH, Kubernetes API, HTTPS, PostgreSQL or MySQL wire protocols. Think a
  "smart sidecar" which routes user requests from a proxy to its target
  resource.

    The `teleport` binary provides all three services. They can be enabled or
    disabled via configuration or command line flags. To create a single-node
    cluster, launch a single instance of the `teleport` daemon with all services
    enabled.

## How Teleport Cluster Works

The concept of a cluster is the foundation of the Teleport security model.

- Users and servers all must join the same cluster before access can be granted.
- To join a cluster, both users and servers must authenticate and receive certificates.
- The Teleport auth service is the CA of the cluster, which issues certificates
  for all supported protocols.

This model prevents honeypot attacks and eliminates the issue of trust on first
use. This also allows users to enumerate all servers and other resources that
are currently online.

Teleport clusters can be configured to trust each other. This allows users
from one organization to access designated servers inside of another
organization’s cloud or on-premise environment.

## User Experience

Users of [Teleport Desktop](https://goteleport.com/desktop-access/) access simply 
use a browser to access Windows hosts.  

Teleport users of SSH, Kubernetes, and other command line-based clients, must 
authenticate first by executing the `tsh login` command. This command opens a 
web browser to authenticate and exits upon successful authentication. This configures 
users' CLI environment with short-lived certificates for access.

After that, users will be able to access their SSH servers, Kubernetes clusters,
web applications or databases. Teleport is backward compliant with existing
client tools so users can continue to use `ssh`, `psql`, `mysql` or `kubectl`
commands as usual:

```bash
# First, 'tsh' commands authenticates users and configures other
# CLI tools with a client's certificate:
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy.example.com

# SSH access as usual:
$ ssh user@host

# Kubernetes access as usual:
$ kubectl get pods

# Database access as usual:
$ psql
```

## How Authentication Works

Teleport proxy serves the login screen on `https://proxy.example.com:3080`
where users are asked for their username, password, and a 2nd factor. If a 3rd
party identity such as Github is used, the proxy forwards the user to Github
using OAuth2.

The proxy sends the user’s identity to the Teleport auth service. In turn, the
auth service issues certificates for SSH, Kubernetes, and other resources in a
cluster, and sends them back to the client via the proxy.

The client receives the certificates from the proxy, stores them in the user’s
`~/.tsh` directory, and loads them into the ssh-agent if one is running.

[certificate-based SSH authentication](/teleport/how-it-works/certificate-based-authentication-ssh-kubernetes/).

## Audit Log

The Teleport Auth service maintains the audit log of everything happening
inside the environment. The audit log consists of two components:

- _The event log_. It consists of well-documented JSON records of security
  events. Examples of such events include login attempts, file transfers, code
  execution, filesystem changes, or network activity.
- _The recorded sessions_. All users’ interactive sessions to cluster nodes via
  the ssh and kubectl commands are recorded for future replay.

The Auth service stores both types of audit on a local file system by
default, but can be configured to use S3, DynamoDB, and other suitable data
stores.

The recorded sessions are stored as flat ASCII files and can be easily analyzed
by 3rd party software. For example, one can “replay” a session by dumping a
session file to stdout using `cat` command.

for the supported protocols.

## Access for Edge Networks

Teleport allows users to access resources running on devices that are located
anywhere in the world, for example devices on 3rd party networks or via a cellular
connection. Examples of this include self-driving vehicles, network equipment,
retail locations, medical devices, etc.

To make this work, each remote device must be configured to point at a Teleport
Proxy public address, like `proxy.example.com`. This allows each device to
establish and maintain a permanent reverse tunnel to the cluster to which it
belongs. This tunnel is used to proxy user connections into devices. The tunnel
is automatically re-established if the network connectivity is intermittent.

Reverse tunnels enable Teleport users to:

- Manage IoT devices via SSH.
- Access Kubernetes clusters located on edge or IoT platforms.
- Access Web applications running on 3rd party private networks.
- Access MySQL and PostgreSQL databases running in remote environments.
