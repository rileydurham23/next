        Building a platform to support millions of users is a challenge. You
        have to move faster than your competitors & introduce new features, all
        while protecting consumer data. Even without compliance requirements
        like GDPR and CCPA, the reputation risk that comes with a major breach
        is reason enough to focus on security from the get-go. The tension
        between fast growth and security that protects your customers and
        reputation is real.
