       Building a platform to support millions of users is a challenge. You have to move faster than your competitors & introduce new features, all while protecting consumer data. Even without compliance requirements like GDPR and CCPA, the reputation risk that comes with a major breach is reason enough to focus on security from the get-go. The tension between fast growth and security that protects your customers and reputation is real.
