        Protecting critical infrastructure requires a well-thought out PAM
        strategy. However, traditional Privileged Access Management solutions
        have not kept up with modern developer practices. Traditional PAM slows
        developers down by constantly sending them to a centralized vault to
        checkout credentials, and encourages insecure workarounds that leave you
        exposed to security threats and compliance violations.

        Teleport delivers essential PAM capabilities such as zero standing
        privileges, just-in-time (JIT) access and activity logging so that you
        can protect your critical infrastructure. With Teleport, you can easily
        enforce MFA, RBAC, and SSO using identity-based, short-lived
        certificates.
      </>

    <ProductBanner.Item title="Zero-standing privileges">
      Teleport enables you to implement zero standing privileges for all your
      infrastructure resources including Linux & Windows servers, Kubernetes
      clusters, databases and internal applications.

    <ProductBanner.Item title="Just-in-time access">
      Approve or deny privilege escalation requests using flexible access
      requests. Approve or deny access via ChatOps, Slack, PagerDuty, or access
      approval can be customized via the programmable API.
    </ProductBanner.Item>
    <ProductBanner.Item title="Session logging & recordings">
      Observe every online resource, every connection, every interactive
      session, in real time. Teleport records all events into a structured audit
      log or recording, making it easy to see what’s happening and who is
      responsible.

        Teleport was built to maximize developer productivity. Instead of
        constantly checking out credentials from a centralized vault, Teleport
        enables identity-based, passwordless access to infrastructure resources
        directly.
      </>
    }

    <ProductBanner.Item title="Seamless access">
      Because Teleport uses short-lived certificates instead of shared
      credentials, developers just need to authenticate via SSO one time to
      access any infrastructure resource.

    <ProductBanner.Item title="ChatOps">
      Engineering teams can easily manage privilege escalation requests via the
      tools they already use like Slack and JIRA.

    <ProductBanner.Item title="Works with dev tools">
      Teleport enables developers to use the tools they love like OpenSSH and
      native database clients instead of subpar tooling that ships with the PAM.

  ‘Shifting left’ has become a thing in security circles, and addressing the
  needs of developers is no less true in the privileged access management
  market. Teleport’s Access Plane combines connectivity, authentication,
  authorization and auditing functionality into a single PAM platform that could
  rightly be viewed as ‘Okta for infrastructure.'
