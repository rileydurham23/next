        Growing your SaaS business means bringing on new verticals and selling
        more to existing customers. But as you move up-market, the stakes change
        — you have to comply with HIPAA, FedRamp, or GDPR regulations, and pass
        rigorous audits before signing on new customers. When it comes time to
        IPO, your stack will be scrutinized, and you will need to demonstrate
        rigorous access controls, authn and authz workflows, and auditability.
