    <h1>Privileged Access Management (PAM) for Kubernetes</h1>

    Kubernetes is being adopted throughout enterprise IT as the de facto container
    orchestration service. Along with this adoption, companies are struggling with the
    “day-two” operational tasks such as managing usage, training users and securing clusters.
    Securing clusters has become a primary concern as unmanaged access to Kubernetes
    can lead to critical vulnerabilities throughout an organization’s private infrastructure.

    Teleport can be used as a proxy to your Kubernetes clusters in order to secure your infrastructureand improve visibility into access and behavior. It also gives you a single control plane to manage both SSH and Kubernetes access, reducing your operational overhead.

          <b>Unified cluster level permissions.</b> Teleport seamlessly
          integrates with Kubernetes role based access controls ("RBAC") so you
          can connect permissions set in your identity manager with permissions
          for your Kubernetes clusters and these permissions are enforced for
          SSH access as well. This makes it impossible to "bypass" Kubernetes
          RBAC via SSH or vice versa.

          <b>Audit log and session recording.</b> Teleport's strong audit and
          compliance features apply to Kubernetes clusters as well. Interactive
          sessions or remote commands launched via kubectl are recorded and can
          be replayed for compliance, knowledge sharing or root-cause analyses.
