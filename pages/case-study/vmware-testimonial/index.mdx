## Key Benefits of Teleport for VMware

- <b>Cost Savings.</b> VMware had no special hardware to procure and no specialized
  knowledge. Teleport just fit into their existing infrastructure and existing processes.
- <b>Reduction in Security Overhead.</b> VMware simply deployed a node in their infrastructure
  when they onboarded a customer and had it talk back to a proxy in Teleport’s infrastructure.
- <b>Peace of Mind.</b> Teleport allows VMware to securely reach the customer’s infrastructure
  without being on site and has the necessary auditability and compliance features
  that address the requirements of both, the customers’ security team and VMware’s
  security team.
